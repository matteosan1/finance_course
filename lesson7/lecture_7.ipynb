    "\n",
    "Just like a discount curve is a way of representing the underlying interest rates implicit in the market quotes of a collection of real-world interest rate products, **credit curves** are a way of representing the data implied by credit default swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit default swaps** (**CDS**) are instruments whose value depends on the likelihood that a given company (the curve's **issuer**) will suffer a credit event over a given period.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **credit event** can be a default, the failure to make payments, the issuer entering into bankruptcy proceedings, or the occurence of other legal events. The exact definition of what constitutes a credit event depends on a series of factors and is usually defined in some kind of ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) master agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, we will generically call a credit event a *default*, and talk about **non-default probabilities** (**NDP**), i.e. the probability that the issuer will not suffer a credit event before a given value date. \n",
    "\n",
    "NDPs are the equivalent for credit curves of discount factors for discount curves. Just like discount curves, credit curves are built by specifying a pricing/observation date, a sequence of pillar dates and a sequence of NDPs. We will then implement a `CreditCurve` class that provides a method which log-linearly interpolates these pillar NDPs to return the NDP at an arbitrary value date between the pricing date and the last pillar date.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we'll also write a method which returns the **hazard rate** at an arbitrary value date. The hazard rate is the credit curve equivalent of the short rate or overnight rate for discount curves. It represents the instantaneous probability of the issuer defaulting conditioned on it not having defaulted until that moment - though in practice we'll calculate it numerically, and therefore it'll be the (annualized) conditional probability of the issuer defaulting between the value date and the day after.\n",
