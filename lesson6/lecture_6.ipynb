    "\n",
    "Last week we looked at how to extract ('bootstrap' or 'calibrate') a discount curve from observed market quotes.\n",
    "This week we're going to move on using that discount curve to price EURIBOR/LIBOR interest rate swaps and swaptions."

    "## Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by reminding ourselves of the differences and similarities between the EONIA/OIS and EURIBOR/LIBOR interest rate markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarity:\n",
    "    * both are unsecured lending, i.e. the lender assumes the risk of losing the capital if the borrower fails during the lending period;\n",
    "    * both represent some kind of 'average' interest rate between similar, large financial institutions.\n",
    "* Difference:\n",
    "    * EONIA/OIS:\n",
    "        * are related to overnight lending, which needs to be renewed each day. This means that each day the lender can choose to not renew the loan or lend the capital to a different borrower;\n",
    "        * rates are a volume-weighted average of real transactions.\n",
    "    * EURIBOR/LIBOR:\n",
    "        * refer to term lending, i.e. lending periods such as one month, three months, etc. The lender needs to wait until the expiration of the loan before having the option to lend the capital to a different borrower;\n",
    "        * are determined through a survey of panel banks' percieved market rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive understanding of the interest rate markets would lead one to believe that these different markets (O/N, 1M, 3M, etc) can all be priced with a single discount curve - indeed in periods of low market stress, this has been the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, the details of the liquidity and counterparty risk involved in each type of transaction are such that there is a basis between these markets, and therefore each one has a different discount (or rate) curve associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## EURIBOR/LIBOR swaps and swaptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the fact that LIBOR curves do not represent a *pure* interest rate market but incorporate elements of liquidity and counterparty risk, it is surprising that, so many years after the financial crisis, they still maintain so much importance as benchmark rate markets for a wide range of purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, though OIS markets are fully liquid enough to extract information about forward interest rates, there is no functioning options market from which to extract information about the volatility of those interest rates. The liquidity in rate volatility continues to be present only in the LIBOR swaptions markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it continues to be important for banks to be able to price and calibrate market parameters against LIBOR instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of today's lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start writing a class which represents and interest rate swap (IRS) on a LIBOR index. The class will have a method which, given a discount curve and a forward rate curve, will calculate the NPV of the swap. The latter curve will be used for determining the forward rates to calculate the expected value of the floating leg cash flows, whereas the former curve will be used to discount both the floating and fixed leg cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll write a similar class for interest rate swaptions. We'll add a method for calculating the NPV analytically using the Black-Scholes formula, and then an additional method for calculating the same NPV via a Monte-Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interest Rate Swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest rate swaps consist of a floating leg and a fixed leg. The contract parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* start date $d_0$\n",
    "* notional $N$\n",
    "* fixed rate $K$\n",
    "* floating rate tenor (months)\n",
    "* maturity (years)\n",
    "\n",
    "The floating leg pays the reference LIBOR fixing at a frequency equal to the tenor of the floating rate - so for example an IRS on a 3-month LIBOR will pay a floating coupon every three months, an IRS on 6-month EURIBOR pays the floating coupon every six months and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed leg pays a predetermined cash flow at annual frequency, regardless of the tenor of  the underlying floating rate. We will only consider swaps with maturities which are multiples of 1 year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can modify the function in finmarkets.py to generate the payment dates for both the fixed and floating legs, as follows:"
