    "* basic Python;\n",

    "## This lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to look at how extract a discount curve from OIS market data, via a process called *bootstrapping*. This is the ABC of financial mathematics, since you almost always need a discount curve to price any contract, especially if you're interested in its NPV. We're going to concentrate on EONIA swaps in order to build an EUR discount curve."

    "\n",
    "The first problem is actually getting the data from somewhere, and this is not actually as simple as it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that the EONIA swap market is Over The Counter (OTC) and it's not straightforward to access it. Unlike (some) listed futures, where anyone with a retail brokerage account can view and apply realtime prices, to trade in the EONIA swap market you have to be a financial institution or at least a large company and have an agreement with a broker which operates in the market. One of the main brokers in the OIS market is ICAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there exist some electronic platform in which market participants post bids and offers and other participants can apply them, in practice a lot of trading is still done over \"voice\", i.e. by phone or more commonly over chat. For convenience, however, Bloomberg provides a service which displays indicative realtime prices as provided by a selection of relevant brokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](icap_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our Quants duties we have set up an Excel spreadsheet which acquires this data from Bloomberg in realtime. From this spreadsheet, it's easy to export the data into a Python file - I have done this and saved the data in a module called ```ois_data.py```. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a data set extracted in this way, and derive from it the corresponding discount curve."

    "In the next we are going to somehow reverse what we did last week where we determined the OIS's NPV given a certain discount curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea here is to find the discount curve such that it prices correctly each OIS, or at least as well as possible, by minimizing the sum of the square NPVs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{min}_{curve} \\Big\\{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{NPV}(\\mathrm{ois}_i, \\mathrm{curve})^2\\Big\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This description of the problem does not, in theory, specify any constraints on the pillar dates of the discount curve. However, the pillar dates determine the number of unknown variables (i.e. the dimensionality $n$ of the optimization problem). A curve with $n$ pillar dates has $n$ pillar discount factors (note that the first discount factor with value date equal to the today date, is constrained to 1, so it doesn't count).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, therefore, it makes sense to choose the pillar dates in such a way that there are exactly the right number of degrees of freedom in the optimization to match data. So the natural choide is to choose the pillar dates of the discount curve equal to the set of expiry dates of the swaps so that in principle we could find a vector of pillar discount factor that perfectly recover a zero NPV for every swap. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is that each market quote will determine exactly one *free* discount factor which is not already determined by the other market quotes - this can be seen by considering the mathematical expression for calculating the fixed leg of the OIS swaps ($f_{\\mathrm{fix},~i}=N\\cdot K\\cdot \\frac{d_i - d_{i-1}}{360}$), and the way that the payment date schedules are constructed.\n",
    "Therefore, once we've fixed $\\vec{d}$ to be a vector of pillar dates equal to the expiry dates of the OIS swaps, and we use the notation $\\vec{x}$ to represent the vector of pillar discount factors, then the problem becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{min}_{\\vec{x}} \\Big\\{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{NPV}(\\mathrm{ois}_i, \\mathrm{curve(\\vec{d}, \\vec{x})})^2\\Big\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this is an optmization problem: **to find the minimum of the above expression as a function of $\\vec{x}$**, so we can just use one the available numerical optimization routines.\n",
