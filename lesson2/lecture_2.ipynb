    "# Introduction to Python - Lesson 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson the basic concept of Python programming have been looked at\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```print``` statements and variables\n",
    "* mathematical expressions\n",
    "  * first import of a module (```math```)\n",
    "* boolean expressions\n",
    "* string expressions\n",
    "* indentation, ```if/elif/else``` blocks and loops\n",
    "* lists\n",
    "* dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we will look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "* tuples\n",
    "* dates\n",
    "* functions and modules (how to write your own module)\n",
    "* few exercises for next week\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples create a bit of confusion for beginners because they are very similar to lists but they have some subtle conceptual differences. Nonetheless, tuples do appear when programming in Python so it's important to know about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "![At first glance list and tuples look very similar, but they are not...](Difference-Between-List-and-Tuple-fig-1-2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like lists, tuples are containers of any type of object. Unlike lists though they are *immutable* which means that once they have been created the content cannot be changed (i.e. no append, insert or delete of the elements). Furthermore since they are immutable they can be used as dictionary keys (lists cannot)."
