    "\n",
    "Classes are a key ingredient of *Object Oriented Programming* (OOP) and their concept is implemented in many languages like `Python`, `Java`, `C++`.\n",
    "OOP is a programming model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. **An object can be defined as a dataset with unique attributes and behaviour** (examples can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and birthday, down to abstract concepts as a discount curve). This opposes the historical approach to programming where emphasis was placed on how the logic was written rather than how to define the data within the logic.\n",
    "In this framework classes are a mean for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize here some terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a class is a collection of related functions, and these are called the *methods* of the class;\n",
    "* methods act on *instances* of the class;\n",
    "* an *instance* is basically a collection of related data;\n",
    "* each data item has a name, and those names are called the *attributes* of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Essentially classes are collections of functions that operate on a dataset, and instances of that class represent individual datasets (or in othre words a specialization of that class).**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graphical representation of a class instance.](classes_instances.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods always take the instance `self` as the first argument, and fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* normal methods which use or modify the instance attributes;\n",
    "* special methods, which define the class behaviour: you can spot these because they start and end with two underscores (__).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `self` argument is very important since it allows a method to use its class attributes.\n",
