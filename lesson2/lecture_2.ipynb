    "OOP is a programming model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* a class is a collection of related functions, and these are called the *methods* of the class;\n",
    "* methods act on *instances* of the class;\n",
    "* an *instance* is basically a collection of related data;\n",
    "* each data item has a name, and those names are called the *attributes* of the class.\n",
    "\n",

    "Methods fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* normal methods which use or modify the instance attributes;\n",
