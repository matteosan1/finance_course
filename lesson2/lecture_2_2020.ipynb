    "OOP is a programming model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. \n",

    "\n",
    "* a class is a collection of related functions, and these are called the *methods* of the class;\n",
    "* methods act on *instances* of the class;\n",
    "* an *instance* is basically a collection of related data;\n",
    "* each data item has a name, and those names are called the *attributes* of the class.\n",

    "The image above shows how a Car object can be the template for many other Car instances. In the image, there are three instances: polo, mini, and beetle. Imagine to have a class called Car, that will structure a Car object to contain information about the car’s model, the color, how many passengers it can hold, its speed, etc. A class can define types of operations that can be performed on a Car object. For example, the Car class might specify an accelerate method, which would update the speed attribute of the car object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a way of organizing information about a type of data so a programmer can reuse elements when making multiple instances of that data type—for example, if a programmer wanted to make three instances of Car, maybe a BMW, a Ferrari, and a Ford instance. The Car class would allow the programmer to store similar information that is unique to each car (they are different models, and maybe different colors, etc.) and associate the appropriate information with each car."

For example, in a fantasy story, there are heroes and monsters but both the heroes and the monsters are characters. And both dragons and orcs are monsters. Though dragons and orcs are different monsters, they share some qualities that a reader might want to know: they both have a color, they both have a size, they both have enemies. Orcs might have characteristics that dragons do not; for example, what kind of weapon does the orc carry? Inheritance allows the classes to share information relevant to multiple parts of the code.\n",
