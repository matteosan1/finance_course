    "In the next lesson we're going to build lots of ```OvernightIndexSwap``` objects, one for each market quote we have. The market quotes will consist of fixed strikes for 1M, 2M, 3M, ..., 12M, 15M, 18M, 2Y, 3Y, ..., 30Y and 40Y swaps.\n",

    "It would be very boring to write a long list of payment dates for each one of these, plus they'd need to be updated every day. Write a function which given a start date and the number of months, returns a list of dates of **annual** frequency starting from the start date and ending after the specified number of months.\n",
