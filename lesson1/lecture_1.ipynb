    "# Introduction to $\\tt{python}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last years $\\tt{python}$ popularity has rapidily grown posing this language in the top three of the most used in the world. The reasons of such a success are mainly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is versatile, easy to use and allow fast development;\n",
    "* it is open source and has behind it a vibrant community;\n",
    "* It has all the libraries you can imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the perfomance penalty developers began to use it in fields like finance and physics historically devoted to other languages like $\\tt{C++}$ or $\\tt{java}$.\n",
    "In the first two lessons of this course we'll take a tour of the $\\tt{python}$ programming language. Later on we will see how to write functions and classes which would actually be useful in a real-world finance environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is $\\tt{python}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tt{Python}$ is a so called *interpreted language*: it takes some code, i.e. a sequence of instructions, reads and executes it (in this respect, and only in this one, $\\tt{python}$ is similar to $\\tt{Excel VBA}$). As a result, $\\tt{python}$ is essentially an *interactive* programming language, you can program and see the results almost at the same time. \n",
    "Other programming languages like $\\tt{C}$ or $\\tt{C++}$ instead first *compile* code into a language that the computer can understand directly (*machine language*) and then you can run it. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Interpreted vs compiled language](index.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactivity is very nice in terms of speed of development (the compilation step can be time conuming for big projects, just to give an idea the compilation of our C++ financial code takes more than one hour) but it has performance drawbacks since the translation from human readable to machine language hs to be done real'time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Human readable vs machine suitable code](machine_language.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which $\\tt{python}$ should I use ?\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tt{Python}$, as basically all programs, comes in different version and flavours and they evolves very rapidly as you can see by the number of updates the apps in your mobile phone receives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version is $\\tt{3.8.5}$, however you'll see older versions floating around (e.g. $\\tt{2.7}$). This is because there are some big differences between $\\tt{python 2}$ and $\\tt{python 3}$ which prevent a sizeable portion of $\\tt{python 2}$ users to stick with it since moving to $\\tt{python 3}$ would require a lot of work to adapt the code (this process is usually called *porting*).\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will go for $\\tt{python 3.7}$ !**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I use $\\tt{python}$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have installed a $\\tt{python}$ distribution there are various ways of actually using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the most immediate way is to just execute $\\tt{python.exe}$ on the command line to get a $\\tt{python}$ console for interacting with the interpreter;\n",
    "* if you are learning $\\tt{python}$ or do some simple data analysis, $\\tt{Jupyter~~notebooks} $(i.e. this document) allow to see the results of your code as you write it, as well as make notes, plot graphs beside it;\n",
    "* if you are a programmer and want to do more complex things, you'll usually want to split your code between more files to manage your project more easily. For this last case an integrated development environment (IDE) can be very useful. An IDE is a graphical user interface which makes writing complex code easier by providing a text editor, a file browser, a debugger (a tool that helps you to spot mistakes in your code) all in one software application. Good example is $\\tt{PyCharm}$ (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online courses\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\tt{Python}$ popularity is growing every day so it is very easy to find good (and free) online courses looking into the web. Since in this course we do not have time to cover in depth the potentiality of this language I strongly suggest you to spend some time in watching one of them. One example could be\n",
