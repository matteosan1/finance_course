the algorithm is not provided with any pre-assigned labels or scores for the training data.\n","* As a result, unsupervised learning algorithms must first self-discover any naturally occurring patterns in that training data set. \n","  * **clustering**: where the algorithm automatically groups its training examples into categories with similar features;\n","  * **principal component analysis** where the algorithm finds ways to compress the training data set by identifying which features are most useful for discriminating between different training examples, and discarding the rest. \n","\n","## k-Means Algorithm\n","\n","* k-means clustering aims to partition (split) $n$ observations into $k$ clusters in which each point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid). \n","  * Given observations $(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ the algorithm divides the $n$ observations into $k$ $(\\leq n)$ sets $S = \\{S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_k\\}$
