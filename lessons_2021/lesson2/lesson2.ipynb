    "## Overnight Index Swap\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest rate swaps (IRS) are usually used to mitigate the risks of fluctuations of varying interest rates, or to benefit from lower rates. We will always look at these products from the point of view of the **receiver of the floating leg**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) are a particular kind of IRS which pay a floating coupon, determined by overnight rate fixings over the reference periods, against a fixed coupon.  By definition an OIS is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a notional amount $N$;\n",
    "* a starting date $d_0$;\n",
    "* a sequence of payment dates $d_1,...,d_n$;\n",
    "* a fixed rate $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity in the following we are assuming that the fixed and floating legs of our OIS have the same notional and payment dates, although this is not necessarily always the case in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OIS Valuation\n",
    "To evaluate the net present value (NPV) of such products the cash flows of each leg have to be calculated; today's NPV then is the sum of all the discounted cash flows.\n",

    "#### Floating leg\n",
    "At each payment date, the floating leg pays a cash flow determined as follows:\n",

    "$$f_{\\mathrm{float},~i} = N \\Bigg\\{\\prod_{d=d_{i-1}}^{d=d_i-1}\\Big(1+r_{\\mathrm{O/N}}(d)\\cdot\\frac{1}{360}\\Big) -1 \\Bigg\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking this formula is valid for an EONIA swaps (i.e.~for OIS swaps in EUR) other currencies might have different conventions. The $\\frac{1}{360}$ fraction appears because EONIA rates are quoted using the ACT/360 day-count convention. In addition we are making the simplifying assumption of ignoring weekends and holidays, so we assume that each overnight rate is valid for only one day.\n",
    "The sum of the discounted expected values of these cash flows is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{NPV}_{\\mathrm{float}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_i)\\mathbb{E}[f_{\\mathrm{float},~i}]$$\n",

    "$$\\mathbb{E}[f_{\\mathrm{float},~i}] = N\\cdot\\Big(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i-1})}{D_{\\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i})} - 1\\Big)$$\n",

    "Our ultimate goal is to take a series of Overnight Index Swap quotations, and determine the discount factors implied by their prices. To do this we will build a class to represent OIS and compute its value given particular discount curve. Then we will use this class, with a numerical optimizer, to *invert* the relation which ties the NPV to the discount curve so that the implied discount factors can be determined from OIS prices (market quotes)."

In finance, bootstrap is a method for constructing a (zero-coupon) fixed-income yield curve from the prices of a set of coupon-bearing products, e.g. bonds and swaps.
