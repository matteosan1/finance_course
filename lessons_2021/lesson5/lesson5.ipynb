    "The price of a bond issued by a party is directly linked to the credit rating of that party, since there is always an associated default risk, which means that the borrower might not be able to repay fully or partially the amount of the taken loan.\n",

    "When you have a default probability associated to the issuer to valuate the bond we need to take each possible value of $x$, multiply it by its probability and sum the results. In other words the value of the bond should equal the mathematical expectation of $x$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider for example a bond with 4 year maturity, a face value of €100 which provides 5% yearly coupons. Also the recovery rate $R$ is 40% and the risk-free rate is constant a 3%. Let's try to estimate the default probability of the issuer of this bond, finding from the previous equation the value of $S$ which give the current trading price (€80)."
