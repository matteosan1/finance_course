Discounting adjusts future payments, investment returns and even return of principal on this basis. The bottom line is that if you fail to earn the discount rate, you have actually lost money, since any bank, would at least have given you the discount rate as return for depositing your money with them. Anything less than that would mean that you have not put your money to its best use.\n",
