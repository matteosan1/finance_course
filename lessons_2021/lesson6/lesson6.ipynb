These tranches of securities become the final investment product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tranches are named to reflect their risk profile: senior, mezzanine and subordinated/equity and are delimited by the attachment ($L$) and detachment points ($U$), which represent the percentages of the total principal defining their boundaries. \n",

    "\n",
    "<!----When the accumulated loss of the reference pool is no more than 5% of the total initial notional of the pool, the tranche will not be affected. However, when the loss has exceeded 5%, any further loss will be deducted from the tranche's notional until the detachment point, 10%, is reached.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these tranches has a different level of seniority relative to the others in the sense that a senior tranche has coupon\n",

    "coupon and principal payment priority over an equity tranche. \n",

    "* in a **Synthetic CDO** the underlying reference portfolio is no longer a physical portfolio of bonds or loans, instead it is a *fictitious* portfolio consisting of a number of names each with an associated notional amount. The value of a synthetic CDO usually comes from insurance premiums of credit default swaps paid for by investors. The seller assumes the underlying assets will perform while the investor, on the other hand, assumes the underlying assets will default."
