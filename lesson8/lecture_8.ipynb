    "# Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson we will see how machine learning techniques can be successfully applied to solve financial problems. We will first do a quick tour on the theory behind neural networks and then we will see an example and two practical applications regarding regression and classification issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer**: this lecture just scratches the surface of the machine learning topic which has seen a huge development in the latest years leading to thousands of applications in many different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural network Definition\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN or simply NN) are information processing models that are developed by inspiring from the working principles of human brain. Their most essential property is the ability of learning from sample sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic unit of ANN architecture are neurons which are internally in connection with other neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Model of an artificial neuron.](neuron.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron consists of weights ($w_i$) and real numbers ($x_i$). All inputs injected into a neuron are individually weighted, added together and passed into the activation function which produce the neuron output. There are many different types of activation function but one of the simplest is the *step function* which returns just 0 or 1 according to the input value (another is the *sigmoid* which can be thought of as the continuous version of the step function). \n",
    "\n",
    "![Step function.](step_function.png)\n",
    "![Sigmoid function.](sigmoid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training of a neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "When teaching children how to recognize a bus, we just tell them, showing an example: “This is a bus. That is not a bus.” until they learn the concept of what a bus is. \n",
    "Furthermore, if the child sees new objects that she hasn’t seen before, we could expect her to recognize correctly whether the new object is a bus or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the idea behind neurons.\n",
    "Similarly, inputs from a *training* set are presented to the neuron one after the other together with the correct output and the neuron weights are modified accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an entire pass through all of the input training vectors is completed the neuron has learnt ! \n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, if an input vector $\\vec{P}$ (already in the training set) is given to the neuron, it will output the correct value. If $\\vec{P}$ is not in the training set, the network will respond with an output similar to other training vectors close to $\\vec{P}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately using just a neuron is not too useful since it is not possible to solve\n",
    "the interesting problems we would like to face with just that simple architecture. The next step is then to put together more neurons in *layers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-layered neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "![A multi-layered neural network.](multilayer.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each input from the *input layer* is fed up to each node in the next hidden layer, and from there to each node on the output layer. We should note that there can be any number of nodes per layer and there are usually multiple hidden layers to pass through before ultimately reaching the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But to train this network we need a learning algorithm which should be able to tune not only the weights between the output layer and the hidden layer but also the weights between the hidden layer and the input layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Back propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to tune the weights at each layer at every iteration we should know what the output would be at each node. But this is not possbile since the only value we know is the correct output at the last node (the final output of the NN which can be compared to our truth of the training output).\n",
    "The method that was suggested to overcome the issue was to take the errors at the output layer (last node) and proportionally propagate it backwards to all the hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what it's going to happen is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* present a training sample to the neural network (initialized with random weights);\n",
    "* compute the output received by calculating activations of each layer and thus calculate the error as the difference between the NN output and the training sample expected result;\n",
    "* having calculated the error, readjust the weights such that the error (difference) decreases;\n",
    "* continue the process for all training samples several times until the weights are not changing too much (a.k.a. the process converged).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NN error is computed by the *loss function* (usually it is either the mean squared error or the mean absolute error) and an *optimization function* is then \n",
    "used to choose the appropriate weight values in order to reduce the loss function value (we will use *Adam* as optimizator in the following but there are more).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Network Design\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no rule to guide developer into the design of a neural network in terms of number of layers and neuron per layer. The most common strategy is a trail and error one where you finally pick up the solution giving the best accuracy. In general a larger number of nodes is better to catch highly structured data with a lot of feature although it may require larger training sample to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common mistake to avoid is to *overtrain* a NN. Overtraining is what happens when the NN learns too well the training sample but its performance degrade substantially in an independent testing sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "So usually it is required to split the available sample in two parts training and testing (e.g. 80% and 20%) and to use the former to perform the training and the latter to cross-check the performance. **Usually performance are *measured* with the mean square error computed between the truth of the sample and the NN predictions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway as a rule of thumb a NN with just one hidden layer with a number of neurons averaging the inputs and outputs is sufficient in most cases. In the following we will use more complex networks just for illustration, no strong attempt in optimizing the layout has been done though.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Below it will be illustrated few practical applications of neural network trainings in python. \n",
    "Various modules are available to develop neural network in ```python```, we will\n",
    "use ```Keras``` a relatively high level library which in turn use ```TensorFlow``` a very famous machine learning tool developed by Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the attempt of keeping things as simple as possible I have added another layer above ```Keras```, ```FinNN``` so that you can try \n",
    "to design some NN without caring too much about the many details and parameters that are involved in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function approximation \n",
    "\n",
    "As a first practical example let's try to design an ANN which is capable of learning the functional form underlying a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's generate a sample with $x$ (input), $f(x)$ (truth) pairs where $f(x) = x^2$ and let's start to code the NN structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the necessary modules.\n",
    "Then we generate the training sample (i.e. the $x$, $f(x)$ pairs) and apply a simple transformation on the sample in order to have all the inputs and outputs in the $[0, 1]$ range. This is usually done to provide the NN with *normalized* data, infact the NN can be fooled by large or very small numbers giving unstable results."

    "\n",
    "Simple intuition about how we recognize shapes - \"a 9 has a loop at the top, and a vertical stroke in the bottom right\" - turn out to be not so simple to express algorithmically. When you try to make such rules precise, you quickly get lost in a morass of exceptions and caveats and special cases so that it seems hopeless.\n",

    "![The so-called MNIST training sample](mnist_100_digits.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By increasing the number of training examples, the network can learn more about handwriting, and so improve its accuracy. So while I've shown just 100 training digits above, we could certainly build a better handwriting recognizer by using thousands or even millions or billions of training examples (**as we have seen above neural nets are not capable of extrapolating results, hence it won't recongnize a digit written in some strange way not included in the training sample !!!**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to implement an ANN that is capable of recognizing handwritten digits.\n",
    "To start we need to install another module, ```mnist``` which containes various predefined training samples.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our program will be based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is specifically designed for image/pattern recognition. We won't go in the details since it is outside the scope of this lecture but it works essentially by applying on top of an image a series of filters (*convolutional layers*) that works as edge detectors and with them it classifies the images according to their relevant features.\n",
    "\n",

    "![](edges.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important difference with respect to the previous examples is that in this case we are going to solve a classification problem (contrary to before when we were trying to regress a sample or in other word to approximate a function). Indeed our NN output won't be a single number but rather a vector containing the probabilties that a handwritten digit was 0, 1, 2, ..., 8 and 9."
