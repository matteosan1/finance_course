    "\n",
    "Computationally, this method involves computing the quantile function of the distribution, in other words, computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distribution (which maps a number in the domain to a probability between 0 and 1) and then inverting that function. We won't go into the details but we will just show few examples of how this can be done in $\\tt{python}$.\n",

For example, if we toss a coin 10 times and we are interested in how many times it will land on heads, the probability of it lending one, two, three, up to 10 head in a row will form a distribution of probabilities or binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution answers to the question which is the probability of exactly k successes on n repeated trials given that:\n",
    " \n",
    "* the number of observations or trials is fixed;\n",
    "* each observation or trial is independent. Like in the coin toss, the previous toss doesn’t affect the following;\n",
    "* the probability of success is exactly the same from one trial to another. Each coin toss has 50% chances to fall in heads or tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{PMF_{binomial}} = \\binom{n}{k} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$\n",

    "where $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient and is equal to $\\frac{n!}{k!(n−k)!}$, $p$ is the probability of an outcome."
