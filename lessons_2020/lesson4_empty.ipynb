    "### Minimization with Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "A small petroleum company owns two refineries. Refinery 1 costs `$20,000` per day to operate, and it can produce 400 barrels of high-grade oil, 300 barrels of medium-grade oil, and 200 barrels of low-grade oil each day. Refinery 2 is newer and more modern. It costs `$25,000` per day to operate, and it can produce 300 barrels of high-grade oil, 400 barrels of medium-grade oil, and 500 barrels of low-grade oil each day. The company has orders totaling 25,000 barrels of high-grade oil, 27,000 barrels of medium-grade oil, and 30,000 barrels of low-grade oil. How many days should it run each refinery to minimize its costs and still refine enough oil to meet its orders?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: you need to identify the unknown quantities (working days for each refinery) and set the constraints on the production of barrels. The objective is to minimize the costs. If you have multiple constraints you can define a list of dictionaries (one for constraint). Furthermore in this case the constraint is not equal to but rather greater than so you have to set ineq type."

    "\n",
    "The modern version of the Monte Carlo method was invented in the late 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam, while he was working on nuclear weapons projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods, or experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results; the underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in many fields: Engineering,\n",
    "Physics, Computational biology, Computer graphics, Applied statistics,\n",
    "Artificial intelligence for games, Search and rescue and of course\n",
    "Finance and business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean of independent samples of the variable. \n",
    "\n",

    "* generate inputs randomly from a probability distribution over the domain defined above;\n",
    "* perform a deterministic computation on the inputs;\n",
    "* aggregate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pseudo-Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods require large amounts of random numbers to generate the inputs, and it was their use that spurred the development of pseudorandom number generators. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main reason why every programming language has libraries that allows to produce huge series of random numbers (with a periodicity of $2^{19937}$).\n",
    "Those numbers are produced by algorithms that take as input a *seed* which determines univokely the series. This means that setting the same seed you will produce the same set of numbers every time (which is great for debugging purpouses).\n",

    "In $\\tt{python}$ the right module to use is `random` which has the following useful functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `seed` set the seed of the random number generator;\n",
    "* `random` returns a random number between 0 and 1 (with uniform probability);\n",
    "* `randint(min, max)` returns an integer random number between `min` and `max` (with uniform probability);\n",
    "* `sample(aList, k=n)` samples n elements from the list `aList`.\n",
