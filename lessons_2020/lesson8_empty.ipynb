    "Credit VaR is defined in the usual way Value at Risk measures are defined (i.e. as percentile of a loss distribution). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we are concerned with the default risk associated to one or multiple counterparties in our portfolio (while previously VaR was concerned with market risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute Credit VaR we need to consider the exposure $EE$ at the default date $\\tau$ defined as the sum of the discounted cash flows at the default; the corresponding loss is then given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\tau, \\hat{T}) = (1 − R)\\cdot EE(\\tau)$$\n",

    "where $\\hat{T}$ is the risk horizon and $L$ is non-zero only in scenarios of early default of the counter-party. \n",

    "Given the above definitions we can express the Credit VaR as the q-quantile of $L(\\tau, \\hat{T})$.\n",
    "In this case the time horizon considered is usually one year and the chosen standard percentile is the 99.9th, so that the returned loss is exceeded only in 1 case out of 1000."

    "### Credit Valuation Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a portfolio of derivatives with a counter-party. If the counter-party defaults and the present value of the portfolio at default is positive to the surviving party, then the surviving party only gets a recovery fraction of the portfolio value from the defaulted entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "If however the present value is negative to the surviving party, it has to pay it in full to the liquidators of the defaulted entity. This creates and asymmetry that, once one has done all calculations, says that the value of the deal under counter-party risk is the value without counter-party risk minus a positive adjustment, called Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be expressed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{CVA} = ( 1 − R )\\int^{T}_{0} D(t)\\cdot EE(t) dQ(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is the latest maturity in the portfolio, $D$ is the discount factor, $EE$ is the expected exposure or $\\mathbb{E}[ \\textrm{max(0, NPV portfolio)}]$ and $dQ$ is the probability of default between $t$ and $t+dt$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an easier computation it is natural to discretize the above integral and use a time grid going from 0 to the maturity of the portfolio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{CVA} = ( 1 − R ) \\sum_i D(t_i)\\cdot EE(t_i) Q(t_{i − 1}, t_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that while Credit VaR measures the risk of losses you face due to the possible default of some counter-parties you are having business with, CVA measures the pricing component of this risk, i.e. the adjustment to the price of a product due to this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debit Valuation Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "This very same adjustment seen from the point of view of our counter-party is positive, and is called Debit Valuation Adjustment, DVA. It is positive because the early default of the client itself would imply a discount on the client payment obligations, and this means a gain in a way. So the client marks a positive adjustment over the risk free price by adding the positive amount called DVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically when both parties have the possibility to default, they consistently include both defaults into the valuation. Hence every party needs to include its own default besides the default of the counter-party into the valuation. So they will mark a positive CVA to be subtracted and a positive DVA to be added to the default risk free price of the deal. The CVA of one party will be the DVA of the other one and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{price = default risk free price + DVA - CVA}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since\n",
    "$$\\textrm{default risk free price(A) = − default risk free price(B)}$$\n",

In other words, it represents the slope of the regression line, which is the market return vs. the individual stocks return. $\\beta$ is used in the CAPM to describe the relationship between systematic risk, or market risk, and the expected return of an asset. By definition, we say that the overall market has a beta of 1.0 and individual stocks are ranked by how volatile they are relative to the market. If $\\beta$ of an individual stock = 1.0, this means its price is perfectly correlated with the market, i $\\beta < 1.0$, which is referred to as \"defensive\", this indicates the security is theoretically less volatile than the market, while if $\\beta > 1.0$, or \"aggressive\", this indicates the assets price is more volatile than the market;\n",

    "To use CAPM it is enough to pick individual stocks or portfolios, and compare them to different indexes (as proxies for the whole market). The point is to find stocks that have high $\\beta$, and portfolios that have high $\\alpha$.

    "### Maximum Diversification Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to minimum variance, and risk parity/budgeting, maximum diversification is also another well known risk based asset allocation technique.\n",
    "\n",

    "In a 2008 paper, the diversification ratio $D$ of a portfolio has been defined as:\n",

    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the vector of volatilities and $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. The term in the denominator is the volatility of the portfolio and the term in the numerator is the weighted average volatility of the assets. More diversification within a portfolio decreases the denominator and leads to a higher diversification ratio."
