    "\n",

This creates and asymmetry that, once one has done all calculations, says that the value of the deal under counter-party risk is the value without counter-party risk minus a positive adjustment, called Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be expressed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{CVA} = ( 1 − R )\\int^{T}_{0} D(t)\\cdot EE(t) dQ(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is the latest maturity in the portfolio, $D$ is the discount factor, $EE$ is the expected exposure or $\\mathbb{E}[ \\textrm{max(0, NPV portfolio)}]$ and $dQ$ is the probability of default between $t$ and $t+dt$. \n",

So the client marks a positive adjustment over the risk free price by adding the positive amount called DVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically when both parties have the possibility to default, they consistently include both defaults into the valuation. Hence every party needs to include its own default besides the default of the counter-party into the valuation. So they will mark a positive CVA to be subtracted and a positive DVA to be added to the default risk free price of the deal. The CVA of one party will be the DVA of the other one and vice versa.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between expected return of assets and systematic risk of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAPM states that the expected return of an asset is equal to the risk-free return plus a risk premium. The assumption of CAPM is that investors are rational and want to maximize return and reduce risk as much as possible so its goal is to calculate which return an investor can expect to make for a given risk premium over the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we can summarize CAPM with the following formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_i = r_f + \\beta_i(r_m-r_f)$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $r_i$ is the expected return of the $i^{th}$ security;\n",
    "* $r_f$ is the risk-free rate with zero standard deviation (an example of a risk-free asset includes Treasury Bills as they are backed by the U.S. government);\n",
    "* $r_m - r_f$ is the risk premium ($r_m$ denotes the market return including all securities in the market, it can be represented with an index like S\\&P 500);\n",
    "* $\\beta_i$ is a measure of $i^{th}$ asset volatility in relation to the overall market. \n",
    "$\\beta$ is used in the CAPM to describe the relationship between systematic risk, or market risk, and its expected return.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Therefore the key point in CAPM is the determination of $\\beta$. This can be achieved with the measurement of the slope of the *regression line*, of the market vs individual stock return distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two sets of measurements $X$ and $y$ the linear regression determines the parameter $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that\n",

    "\n",
    "so provides insights about how *volatile*, or how risky, a stock is relative to the rest of the market.\n",
    "In CAPM $\\beta$ calculation is used to help investors understand whether a stock moves in the same direction as the rest of the market but for it to provide any useful insight, the market that is used as a benchmark should be related to the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\beta$ of an individual stock = 1.0, this means its price is perfectly correlated with the market, if $\\beta < 1.0$, which is referred to as \"defensive\", this indicates the security is theoretically less volatile than the market (provides lower returns, so it is less risky), while if $\\beta > 1.0$, or \"aggressive\", this indicates the assets price is more volatile than the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who use CAPM pick individual stocks or portfolios, and compare them to different indexes. The point is to find stocks that have high $\\beta$, and portfolios that have high $\\alpha$. High $\\beta$ values mean that the stock fares better than index, so those stocks have a chance at beating the market. $\\alpha$ values above zero mean that your portfolio gives positive return no matter what the market does."
