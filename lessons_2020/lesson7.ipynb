    "## Modelling Correlation between Risks\n",
    "In credit derivative valuation and credit risk management, one of the most important issue is the estimate of default probabilities and their correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Default correlation measures the tendency of two companies to default at about the same time. For this, generally speaking, there are two ways: using historical default data or using mathematical models, like copulas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Historical default data has played an important role in the estimation of default probabilities. However, because default events are rare, there is very limited default data available. Moreover, historical data reflects the historical default pattern only and it may not be a proper indicator of the future. This makes the estimation of default probabilities from historical data difficult and inexact. To use this same data to estimate default correlations is even more difficult and more inexact. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand mathematical models don't rely on historical default data. So this is the way that is now used to estimate/apply correlations."

    "\n",
    "For example, in the last case, the\n",

    "We now present some numerical results for an $n$th-to-default basket. We assume that the\n",

    "The valuation procedure is similar to that for a regular CDS where there is only one\n",

    "\n",
    "In a regular CDS indeed its valuation is based on the probability that a default\n",
