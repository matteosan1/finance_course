    "\n",
    "A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) is a credit derivative where the issuer, typically investment banks, gather risky assets and repackage them into discrete classes (*tranches*) based on the level of credit risk assumed by the investor. These tranches of securities become the final investment product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tranches are named to reflect their risk profile: senior, mezzanine and subordinated/equity and are delimited by the attachment ($L$) and detachment points ($U$), which represent the percentages of the total principal defining their boundaries. \n",
    "For example, a 5-10% tranche has an attachment point of 5% and a detachment point of 10%. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!----When the accumulated loss of the reference pool is no more than 5% of the total initial notional of the pool, the tranche will not be affected. However, when the loss has exceeded 5%, any further loss will be deducted from the tranche's notional until the detachment point, 10%, is reached.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these tranches has a different level of seniority relative to the others in the sense that a senior tranche has coupon\n",
    "and principal payment priority over a mezzanine tranche, while a mezzanine tranche has\n",
    "coupon and principal payment priority over an equity tranche. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed they receive returns using a set of rules known as *waterfall*. Incomes of the portfolio are first used to provide returns to the most senior tranche, then to the next and so on.\n",
    "So the senior tranches are generally safest because they have the first claim on the collateral, although they'll offer lower coupon rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note\n",
    "that a CDO only redistributes the total risk associated with the underlying pool of assets\n",
    "to the priority ordered tranches. It neither reduces nor increases the total risk associated\n",
    "with the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various kind of CDOs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* in a **Cash CDO** the reference portfolio consists of corporate bonds owned by the CDO issuer. Cash flows from collateral are used to pay principal and interest to investors. If such cash flows prove inadequate, principal and interest is paid to tranches according to their seniority. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"cdo_structure.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* in a **Synthetic CDO** the underlying reference portfolio is no longer a physical portfolio of bonds or loans, instead it is a *fictitious* portfolio consisting of a number of names each with an associated notional amount. The value of a synthetic CDO usually comes from insurance premiums of credit default swaps paid for by investors. The seller assumes the underlying assets will perform while the investor, on the other hand, assumes the underlying assets will default."
