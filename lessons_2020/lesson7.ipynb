    "## Collateralized Debt Obligation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) is a credit derivative where the issuer, typically investment banks, gather risky assets and repackage them into discrete classes (*tranches*) based on the level of credit risk assumed by the investor. These tranches of securities become the final investment product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tranches are named to reflect their risk profile: senior, mezzanine and subordinated/equity and are delimited by the attachment ($L$) and detachment points ($U$), which represent the percentages of the total principal defining their boundaries. \n",
    "For example, a 5-10% tranche has an attachment point of 5% and a detachment point of 10%. Which means that when the accumulated loss of the reference pool is no more than 5% of the total initial notional of the pool, the tranche will not be affected. However, when the loss has exceeded 5%, any further loss will be deducted from the tranche's notional until the detachment point, 10%, is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these tranches has a different level of seniority relative to the others in the sense that a senior tranche has coupon\n",
    "and principal payment priority over a mezzanine tranche, while a mezzanine tranche has\n",
    "coupon and principal payment priority over an equity tranche. \n",
    "Indeed they receive returns using a set of rules known as *waterfall*. Incomes of the portfolio are first used to provide returns to the most senior tranche, then to the next and so on.\n",
    "So the senior tranches are generally safest because they have the first claim on the collateral, although they'll offer lower coupon rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note\n",
    "that a CDO only redistributes the total risk associated with the underlying pool of assets\n",
    "to the priority ordered tranches. It neither reduces nor increases the total risk associated\n",
    "with the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various kind of CDOs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* in a **Cash CDO** the reference portfolio consists of corporate bonds owned by the CDO issuer. Cash flows from collateral are used to pay principal and interest to investors. If such cash flows prove inadequate, principal and interest is paid to tranches according to seniority.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"cdo_structure.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* in a **Synthetic CDO** the underlying reference portfolio is no longer a physical portfolio of bonds or loans, instead it is a *fictitious* portfolio consisting of a number of names each with an associated notional amount. The value of a synthetic CDO usually comes from insurance premiums of credit default swaps paid for by investors. The seller assumes the underlying assets will perform. The investor, on the other hand, assumes the underlying assets will default."

    "## Value at Risk \n",
    "\n",
    "The value at risk (VaR) of a portfolio is a function of two parameters (time horizon and confidence level) and it is usually involved when it is important to know to a certain precentage of confidence ($X$) how much will be the maximum loss\n",
    "in the next $N $days. It can be interpreted as the loss level over $N$ days that has a probability of only $(100 - X)\\%$ of being exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically the VaR is the loss corresponding to the $(100-X)\\textrm{th}$ precentile of the distribution of the change in the value of the portfolio over the next $N$ days.\n",
    "For example, with $N=1$ and $X=95$, VaR is the fifth percentile of the distribution of changes in the value of the portfolio over the next day (e.g. in the next picture the graphical representation of the VaR assuming a normal distribution for the changes of value).\n",

    "\n",
    "VaR is useful to summarize all the information about the risk of a portfolio in one single number, but this can be also considered its main limitation (too much simplification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the time horizon parameter it is usually set to $N=1$ since it is not easy to estimate market variables over periods longer than 1 day. To generalize the VaR estimate it is assumed:\n",

    "In order to estimate the VaR from an historical series, we need to collect the market variables affecting the portfolio over the last $N$ days (with $N$ quite large). \n",
    "\n",
    "The variation over each day in our time interval will provide different scenarios to be applied to today's market data so that for each of them we need to compute the variation in the portfolio value ($\\Delta P$). Our VaR estimate will be the (100 - X)% percentile of the resulting distribution.\n",
    "Given the 1-day VaR it is then possible to determine the N-day VaR using the above formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course such historical simulation relies on the assumption that past behaviors are indicative of what might happen in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Imagine a portfolio $P$ whose value depends only on two market variables ($x_1(t) , x_2(t)$). From the historical series of the market variables we can determine various *simulated* portfolio values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_i(t_n+1) = P\\Big(x_1(t_n)\\frac{x_1(t_i)}{x_1(t_{i-1})} , x_2(t_n)\\frac{x_2(t_i)}{x_2(t_{i-1})}\\Big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially rescaling the market variables according to the variation between day $i$ and $i-1$ we can draw a distribution of the possible changes in the portfolio value $P_i$ and then compute the VaR taking the appropriate percentile."

    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{% of defaults} = \\textrm{nDefaults}/n = (n\\cdot DP)/n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $M$ is distributed according to a standard normal we can be $X\\%$ certain that its value will be greater than $\\Phi^{-1}(1−X) = -\\Phi^{-1}(X)$, where the last equality holds due to the symmetry of the Gaussian distribution (e.g. $\\Phi^{-1}(0.95) = -\\Phi^{-1}(0.05))$.\n",

    "### Credit Valuation Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a portfolio of derivatives with a counter-party. If the counter-party defaults and the present value of the portfolio at default is positive to the surviving party, then the surviving party only gets a recovery fraction of the portfolio value from the defaulted entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "If however the present value is negative to the surviving party, it has to pay it in full to the liquidators of the defaulted entity. This creates and asymmetry that, once one has done all calculations, says that the value of the deal under counter-party risk is the value without counter-party risk minus a positive adjustment, called Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be expressed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{CVA} = ( 1 − R )\\int^{T}_{0} D(t)\\cdot EE(t) dP(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is the latest maturity in the portfolio, $D$ is the discount factor, $EE$ is the expected exposure or $\\mathbb{E}[ \\textrm{max(0, NPV portfolio)}]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an easier computation it is natural to discretize the above integral and use a time grid going from 0 to the maturity of the portfolio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{CVA} = ( 1 − R ) \\sum_i D(t_i)\\cdot EE(t_i) P(t_{i − 1}, t_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say that Credit VaR measures the risk of losses you face due to the possible default of some counter-parties you are having business with. CVA measures the pricing component of this risk, i.e. the adjustment to the price of a product due to this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debit Valuation Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjustment seen from the point of view of our counter-party is positive, and is called Debit Valuation Adjustment, DVA. It is positive because the early default of the client itself would imply a discount on the client payment obligations, and this means a gain in a way. So the client marks a positive adjustment over the risk free price by adding the positive amount called DVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically when both parties have the possibility to default, they consistently include both defaults into the valuation. Hence every party needs to include its own default besides the default of the counter-party into the valuation. So they will mark a positive CVA to be subtracted and a positive DVA to be added to the default risk free price of the deal. The CVA of one party will be the DVA of the other one and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{price = default risk free price + DVA - CVA}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since\n",
    "$$\\textrm{default risk free price(A) = − default risk free price(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{DVA(A) = CVA(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{DVA(B) = CVA(A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we get that eventually\n",
    "$$\\textrm{price(A) = − price(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that both parties agree on the price, or, we could say, there is money conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CVA Computation\n",
    "The computation of the CVA is easily carried on with Monte Carlo simulation. First simulate the development of your portfolio (its NPV) at each time point for each MC scenario. Then calculate the CVA using one of the previous definitions. Finally average the CVA of all the scenarios to get its best estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of zero coupon bonds the computation of the CVA can be further simplified. Indeed in this case the exposure of the investor is equal to the notional of the bond, so it is enough to loop through each days from the observation date to the maturity of the bond and compute the CVA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a 3-years bond with a face value N = €100.\n",
    "The bond issuer has the following default probabilities 10%, 20% and 30% for 1, 2 and 3 years respectively (the recovery rate is 40%). The risk free rate is 3%."
