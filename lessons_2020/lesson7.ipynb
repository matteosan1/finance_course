    "## Modelling Correlation between Risks\n",
    "In credit derivative valuation and credit risk management, one of the most important issue is the estimate of default probabilities and their correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Default correlation measures the tendency of two companies to default at about the same time. For this, generally speaking, there are two ways: using historical default data or using mathematical models, like copulas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Historical default data has played an important role in the estimation of default probabilities. However, because default events are rare, there is very limited default data available. Moreover, historical data reflects the historical default pattern only and it may not be a proper indicator of the future. This makes the estimation of default probabilities from historical data difficult and inexact. To use this same data to estimate default correlations is even more difficult and more inexact. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand mathematical models don't rely on historical default data. We have already seen how it is possible to derive default probabilities from market data. Before going into the details of the application of the copula to them let's introduce two more kind of credit derivatives.\n",

    "## Basket Default Swaps\n",
    "A basket default swap is a credit derivative on a portfolio of reference entities. The simplest basket default swaps are the nth-to-default swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to a basket of reference entities, a first-to-default swap provides insurance for only the first default, a second-to-default swap provides insurance for only the second default, an nth-to-default swap provides insurance for only the nth default. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in an nth-to-default swap, the protection seller does not make a payment to the protection buyer for the first n−1 defaulted reference entities, and makes the payment only for the nth defaulted reference entity. Once there is a payment upopn the default of the a defaulted reference entity, the swap terminates. It behaves like a standard CDS but refers to then nth entity.\n"

    "In the example above we have used the multivariate normal which gave rise to the Gaussian copula.However, we can use other and more complex copulas as well. For example we might want to assume the correlation is non-symmetruc which is useful in quant finance where correlations become very strong during market crashes and returns very negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infact, Gaussian copulas are said to have played a key role in the 2008 financial crisis as tail-correlations were severely underestimated. Consider a set of mortgages in CDOs (a particular kind of contract that we are going to see) they are clearly correlated, if one mortgage fails, the likelihood that another failing is increased. In the early 2000s, the banks only knew how to model the marginals of the default rates. An (in)famous paper by Li then suggested to use copulas to model the correlations between those marginals. Rating agencies relied on thid model so heaviy, severely underestimating risk and giving false ratings...\n",
