    "## Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio optimization models are concerned with investment where there are typically two criteria: expected return and risk. The investor wants the former to be high and the latter to be low. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a variety of measures of risk. The most popular measure of risk has been variance in return. Even though there are some problems with it, we will first look at it very closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Markowitz Mean/Variance Portfolio Model\n",
    "The portfolio model, introduced by Markowitz, assumes an investor has two considerations when constructing an investment portfolio: expected return and variance in return (i.e., risk). Variance measures the variability in realized return around the expected return. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Markowitz model requires two major kinds of information: \n",
    "\n",
    "* the estimated expected return for each candidate investment;\n",
    "* the covariance matrix of returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix characterizes not only the individual variability of the return on each investment, but also how each investment’s return tends to move with other investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the appeal of the Markowitz model is it can be solved by efficient quadratic programming methods. Quadratic programming is the name applied to the class of models in which the objective function is a quadratic function and the constraints are linear. Thus, the objective function is allowed to have terms that are products of two variables such as $x_i^2$ and $x_i\\cdot x_j$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Assume that the expected return of the treasury bill is $\\mathbb{E}[R _f] = 3\\%$ and its risk is 0%. Further, assume that the expected return of the stock is $\\mathbb{E}[R_r] = 10\\%$ and its standard deviation is $\\sigma_r = 20\\%$. The question that needs to be answered for any individual investor is how much to invest in\n",

    "In this very simple example, if an investor were to invest 100% into the risk-free asset ($w_f = 1$),\n",
    "the expected return would be 3% and the risk of the portfolio would be 0%. Likewise, investing\n",
    "100% into the stock ($w_f = 0$) would give an investor an expected return of 10% and a portfolio risk\n",

    "Despite the significant utility of the Markowitz theory, there are some major limitations in this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it is difficult to forecast asset returns with accuracy using historical data, which tends to be a poor forecasting source. As return estimations have a much larger impact on the asset allocations, small changes in return assumptions can lead to inefficient portfolios. Therefore, the model tends to lead to highly concentrated portfolios (out-of sample weights) that do not offer as much diversification benefits in practice as they seem to provide in theory;\n",
    "* the model assumes that asset correlations are linear. In reality, asset correlations move dy- namically, changing with the market cycles. During the global financial crisis, asset cor- relations approached almost 1, so if anything, diversification seemed to have insignificant impacts on the portfolios;\n",
    "* last but not the least, the model assumes normality in return distributions. Therefore, it does not factor in extreme market moves which tend to make returns distributions either skewed, fat tailed or both. Without optimising the portfolio for asset that may actually have skewed distributions or fat tailed, it could lead to a riskier allocation that is intended."

    "\n",
    "In addition to minimum variance, and risk parity/budgeting, maximum diversification is also another well known risk based asset allocation technique.\n",

    "Diversification is a common topic in portfolio construction. Rather than serving as the sole, quantifiable objective, it is most often either pursued in tandem with another objective, such as return maximization, or pursued simply by including more asset classes or adding constraints based on intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it does not have to be this way; diversification can be pursued explicitly as the sole objective in portfolio construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2008 paper, the diversification ratio $D$ of a portfolio has been defined as:\n",

    "$$D=\\cfrac{\\mathbf{w^T}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt {\\mathbf{w^T}\\Sigma \\mathbf{w}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the vector of volatilities and $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. The term in the denominator is the volatility of the portfolio and the term in the numerator is the weighted average volatility of the assets. More diversification within a portfolio decreases the denominator and leads to a higher diversification ratio."
