    "## Overnight Index Swap\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest rate swaps (IRS) are usually used to mitigate the risks od fluctuations of varying interest rates, or to benefit from lower rates. We will always look at these products from the point of view of the **receiver of the floating leg**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) are a particular kind of IRS which pay a floating coupon, determined by overnight rate fixings over the reference periods, against a fixed coupon.  By definition an OIS is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a notional amount $N$;\n",
    "* a starting date $d_0$;\n",
    "* a sequence of payment dates $d_1,...,d_n$;\n",
    "* a fixed rate $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity in the following we are assuming that the fixed and floating legs of our OIS have the same notional and payment dates, although this is not necessarily always the case in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OIS Valuation\n",
    "To evaluate the net present value (NPV) of such products the cash flows of each leg have to be calculated; today's NPV then is the sum of all the discounted cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Floating leg\n",
    "At each payment date, the floating leg pays a cash flow determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{\\mathrm{float},~i} = N \\Bigg\\{\\prod_{d=d_{i-1}}^{d=d_i-1}\\Big(1+r_{\\mathrm{O/N}}(d)\\cdot\\frac{1}{360}\\Big) -1 \\Bigg\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking this formula is valid for an EONIA swaps (i.e.~for OIS swaps in EUR) other currencies might have different conventions. The $\\frac{1}{360}$ fraction appears because EONIA rates are quoted using the ACT/360 day-count convention. In addition we are making the simplifying assumption of ignoring weekends and holidays, so we assume that each overnight rate is valid for only one day.\n",
    "The sum of the discounted expected values of these cash flows is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{NPV}_{\\mathrm{float}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_i)\\mathbb{E}[f_{\\mathrm{float},~i}]$$\n",
    "where $D(d)$ is the discount factor with expiry $d$. On the other hand, by definition (remember Lesson~\\ref{calculating-forward-rates} with forward rates), we also have the following relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[f_{\\mathrm{float},~i}] = N\\cdot\\Big(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i-1})}{D_{\\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i})} - 1\\Big)$$\n",

    "at the overnight rate, the OIS curve is itself the correct curve with which to discount the flows of an OIS contract ! --->\n",

    "### Discount Factor Determination from Market Quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to take a series of Overnight Index Swap quotations, and determine the discount factors implied by their prices. To do this we will build a class to represent OIS and compute its value, given particular discount curve. Then we will use this class, put inside a numerical optimizer, to *invert* so that the implied discount factors can be determined from their prices (market quotes)."

In finance, bootstrap is a method for constructing a (zero-coupon) fixed-income yield curve from the prices of a set of coupon-bearing products, e.g. bonds and swaps. The term structure of spot returns is obtained from the bond yields by solving for them recursively, by forward substitution: this iterative process is what is called the bootstrap method. \n",

    "### OIS Example\n",
    "Back to our Overnight Index Swap, the general idea here is to find the discount curve $\\mathcal{C}$ such that it prices as much correctly as possible each OIS by minimizing the sum of the squared OIS NPVs (our $f_i$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{min}_{\\mathcal{C}} \\Big\\{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{NPV}(\\mathrm{OIS}_i, \\mathcal{C})^2\\Big\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A discount curve is characterized by pillar dates and the corresponding discount factors. The description of the problem we have given above does not, in theory, specifies any constraint on the pillar dates of the discount curve $\\mathcal{C}$ we are going to find.\n",
    "However, the pillar dates determine the number of unknown variables (i.e.~the dimensionality \\(N\\) of the optimization problem). A curve with \\(N\\) pillar dates has also \\(N\\) discount factors (note that the first discount factor with value date equal to the today date, is constrained to 1). **In practice, therefore, it makes sense to choose the pillar dates in such a way that there are exactly the right number of degrees of freedom in the optimization to match data.** So the natural choice is to choose the pillar dates of the discount curve equal to the set of expiry dates of the swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, once we've fixed $\\mathbf{d}$ to be a vector of pillar dates equal to the expiry dates of the OIS swaps, and we use the notation $\\mathbf{x}$ to represent the vector of unknown pillar discount factors, then the problem becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{min}_{\\mathbf{x}} \\Big\\{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\mathrm{NPV}(\\mathrm{OIS}_i, \\mathcal{C}(\\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{x}))^2\\Big\\}$$\n",
    "which is our optimization problem (**to find the minimum of the above expression as a function of x**) which can be solved using one of the available numerical optimization routines in $\\tt{python}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first let's create the swaps according to all the available market quotes and also the pillar dates of our final discount curve:"
