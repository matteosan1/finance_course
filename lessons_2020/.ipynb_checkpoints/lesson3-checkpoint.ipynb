    "* a notional amount $N$;\n",
    "* a starting date $d_0$;\n",

    "A discount curve is characterized by pillar dates and the corresponding discount factors. The description of the problem we have given above does not, in theory, specifies any constraint on the number of pillar dates of the discount curve $\\mathcal{C}$ we are going to find.\n",
    "However, the pillar dates determine the number of unknown variables (i.e.~the dimensionality $N$ of the optimization problem). A curve with $N$ pillar dates has also $N$ discount factors (note that the first discount factor with value date equal to the today date, is constrained to 1). **In practice, therefore, it makes sense to choose the pillar dates in such a way that there are exactly the right number of degrees of freedom in the optimization to match data, so equal number of pillars and market quotes.** Hence the natural choice is to choose the pillar dates of the discount curve equal to the set of expiry dates of the swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've fixed $\\mathbf{d}$ to be a vector of pillar dates equal to the expiry dates of the OIS swaps, and we use the notation $\\mathbf{x}$ to represent the vector of unknown pillar discount factors, then the problem becomes:\n",
