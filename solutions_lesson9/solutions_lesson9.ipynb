    "Given the historical series of two stock prices in the file $\\href{https://repl.it/@MatteoSani/support9}{\\textrm{historical_data.py}}$ compute the 5-day 95% VaR for a portfolio consisting of 100 shares of stock 1 and 50 shares of stock 2 (assume that last price of the series is today's price).\n",

    "#### Solution \n",
    "We need to first generate the simulated scenarios rescaling today's market variables using the historical daily variations, then we can compute the $\\Delta P$ distribution with the simulated portfolio values."
