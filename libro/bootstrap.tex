\chapter{Swaps and Bootstrapping}\label{sec:swaps-and-bootstrapping}

In this Chapter the Overnight Index Swap contract is reviewed and a class to represent it will be added to our financial module. Beside financial arguments another very important mathematical technique is introduced: the \emph{bootstrapping}.

\section{Payment Dates Generator}
Before going to describe the Overnight Index Swap we need to develop a tool which helps us to generate list of dates (e.g. payment dates), a task that we need to do often from now on. 
The function we are writing will go in \texttt{finmarkets} module and will be used by the classes describing various kind of contracts.

\section{Overnight Index Swap}\label{overnight-index-swap}

Interest rate swaps (IRS) are generally used to mitigate the risks of
fluctuations of varying interest rates, or to benefit from lower rates.

Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) are a particular kind of IRS which pay a
floating coupon, determined by overnight rate fixings over the reference
periods, against a fixed coupon. By definition an OIS is defined by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a notional amount \(N\);
\item
  a starting date \(d_0\);
\item
  a sequence of payment dates \(d_1,...,d_n\);
\item
  a fixed rate \(K\).
\end{itemize}

For simplicity in the following we are assuming that the fixed and
floating legs of our OIS have the same notional and payment dates,
although this is not necessarily always the case in practice.
We will always look at these products from the point of view of the
\textbf{receiver of the floating leg}.

\subsection{OIS Valuation}\label{ois-valuation}
To evaluate the net present value (NPV) of such products the cash flows
of each leg have to be calculated; today's NPV then is the sum of all
the discounted cash flows.

\subsubsection{Floating leg}\label{floating-leg}

At each payment date, the floating leg pays a cash flow determined as
follows:

\begin{equation}
f_{\mathrm{float},~i} = N \Bigg\{\prod_{d=d_{i-1}}^{d=d_i-1}\Big(1+r_{\mathrm{O/N}}(d)\cdot\frac{1}{360}\Big) -1 \Bigg\}
\label{eq:floating_ois}
\end{equation}

Strictly speaking this formula is valid for an EONIA swaps
(i.e. for OIS swaps in EUR) other currencies might have
different conventions. The \(\frac{1}{360}\) fraction appears because
EONIA rates are quoted using the ACT/360 day-count convention. In
addition we are making the simplifying assumption of ignoring weekends
and holidays, so we assume that each overnight rate is valid for only
one day. The sum of the discounted expected values of these cash flows
is

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{NPV}_{\mathrm{float}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_i)\mathbb{E}[f_{\mathrm{float},~i}]
\end{equation}
where \(D(d)\) is the discount factor with expiry \(d\). On the other
hand we have seen from the forward rate definition (see Section~\ref{calculating-forward-rates}) that

\begin{equation*}
\prod_{i=0}^{d} (1+r_i) = \underbrace{(1+r_{0,1}\Delta T)\underbrace{(1+r_{1,2}\Delta T)\ldots\underbrace{(1+r_{d-2,d-1}\Delta T)(1+r_{d-1,d}\Delta T)}_{=(1+r_{d-2,d}\Delta T)}}_{=(1+r_{1,d}\Delta T)}}_{=(1+r_{0,d}\Delta T)}
\end{equation*}
So Eq.~\ref{eq:floating_ois} can be simplified into

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[f_{\mathrm{float},~i}] = N\cdot\Big(\frac{D_{\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i-1})}{D_{\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i})} - 1\Big)
\end{equation}
hence
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{NPV}_{\mathrm{float}} = N\cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_i) \Big(\frac{D_{\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i-1})}{D_{\mathrm{OIS}}(d_{i})} - 1\Big)
\end{equation}
where \(D_{\mathrm{OIS}}(d)\) is the discount factor implied by OIS
prices (we will see how to derive it).

%The correct curve to use for discounting the flows of a collateralized contract, like OIS, is the one associated with the collateral. Since OIS contracts are collateralized with cash, and cash accrues daily interest at the overnight rate, the OIS curve is itself the correct curve with which to discount the flows of an OIS contract ! 
%From what has been said in Section~\ref{sec:financial-crisis}
%Since the financial crisis, in the Euro area the rates used for
%discounting has been the EONIA rates. Similarly, in other jurisdictions
%it has been used other overnight rates such us Fed fund rates in USA.
%This practice is consistent with the daily remuneration of the
%collateral (i.e. cash given or received as mitigants for credit risk
%arising from the mark to market of the derivatives contract).
%For arbitrage consideration the discounting curve of future cash flows
%in a derivative contract can only be the one derived from the rates
%applied for the collateral.
%
%So we have that \(D = D_{\mathrm{OIS}}\) and the NPV simplifies to

From what has been said in Section~\ref{sec:financial-crisis} we have that 
\(D = D_{\mathrm{OIS}}\) and the NPV simplifies to

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \mathrm{NPV}_{\mathrm{float}} & = N\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}[D(d_{i-1}) - D(d_i)] =  \\
    &= N\cdot[(D(d_{0}) - D(d_{1})) + (D(d_{1}) - D(d_{2})) + ... + (D(d_{n-1}) - D(d_{n}))]\\
    &= N \cdot [D(d_0) - D(d_n)]
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Fixed leg}\label{fixed-leg}

The calculation for the fixed leg is simpler; each cash flow is equal to

\begin{equation}
f_{\mathrm{fixed},~i}=N\cdot K\cdot \frac{d_i - d_{i-1}}{360}
\end{equation}
so the NPV of the fixed leg is

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{NPV}_{\mathrm{fixed}} = N\cdot K\cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_{i})\frac{d_i - d_{i-1}}{360}
\end{equation}

\subsection{\texttt{OvernightIndexSwap} Class}\label{discount-factor-determination-from-market-quotes}

Our ultimate goal is to take a series of Overnight Index Swap
quotations, and determine the discount factors implied by their prices.
To do this we will build a class to represent OIS and compute its value,
given a particular discount curve. Then we will use this class, put inside
a numerical optimizer, to \emph{invert} the relationship that connects 
NPV and discount curve so that the \emph{implied} discount
factors can be determined from OIS market quotes.

\section{Bootstrap Technique}\label{bootstrapping-technique}

As we said before we would like to determine a \emph{real} discount
curve starting from the market quotes of a set of Overnight Index Swaps with different maturities. This will be done via a technique called bootstrapping which is the abc of financial mathematics, since you always need a discount curve to price a contract.

We are going to concentrate on EONIA swaps in order to build an EUR discount curve.

\subsection{Building OIS Instances}
\label{building-ois-instances}

The first step involves getting data, the swap market quotes, and this is not actually as simple as it sounds.

The issue is that EONIA swap market is over the counter (OTC) and it's not straightforward to access it. Unlike (some) listed futures, where anyone with a retail brokerage account can view and apply real time prices, to trade in the EONIA swap market you have to be a financial institution or at least a large company and have an agreement with a broker which operates in the market. One of the most important brokers in the OIS market is ICAP, see Fig.~\ref{fig:icap}.

\begin{figure}[bth]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{figures/icap_3.png}
\caption{Screenshot of market quotes from ICAP.}
\label{fig:icap}
\end{figure}

Though there exist some electronic platform in which market participants post bids and offers and other participants can apply them, in practice a lot of trading is still done over "voice", i.e.~by phone or more
commonly over chat. For convenience, however, Bloomberg provides a service which displays indicative real time rates as provided by a selection of relevant brokers. Note that interest rate swap quotes vary from standard price quotes of commonly traded instruments, they can appear puzzling because the quotes are effectively interest rates.

In the following we use a similarly created dataset (\href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteosan1/finance_course/develop/libro/input_files/ois_quotes.csv}{\texttt{ois\_data.csv}}) to derive our discount curve; with the help of \texttt{pandas} the dataset can be inspected:

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k+kn}{import} \PY{n+nn}{pandas}\PY{o}{,} \PY{n+nn}{datetime}

\PY{n}{observation\PYZus{}date} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{datetime}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{date}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{today}\PY{p}{(}\PY{p}{)}

\PY{n}{mq}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{head}\PY{p}{(}\PY{p}{)}

 maturity   rate
0       1 -0.350
1       2 -0.347
2       3 -0.348
3       4 -0.350
4       5 -0.350
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}
\noindent
Next the dataset could be converted into a dictionary or accessed directly from the \(\tt{DataFrame}\), it is just matter of taste.

Let's say we want to build a 15 months swap instance using data
contained in \(\tt{ois\_data}\). Be careful when doing this
operation and double check the units of rates and quotes. In
this case for example quotes are expressed in percent so you need to
multiply by 0.01 to use them. Another misleading detail to check is that 15 months quote is not the fifteenth entry in the \(\tt{DataFrame}\) (actually it is the twelfth).

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}

Clearly to use the \texttt{npv} method to calculate the OIS's NPV we need a discount curve with which to evaluate it and here comes to hand the bootstrapping technique !

\subsection{Constructing the Yield Curve}\label{the-bootstrapping-technique}

Keep aside for a moment our swaps and introduce the \emph{bootstrap
algorithm}. In finance, bootstrapping is a method for constructing a
(zero-coupon) fixed-income yield curve from the prices of a set of
coupon-bearing products, e.g. bonds and swaps. The term structure of
spot returns is obtained from the bond yields by solving for them
recursively, by forward substitution: this iterative process is what is called the bootstrap method. 

The usefulness of bootstrap resides on that using only a few carefully selected zero-coupon products, it becomes possible to derive forward and spot rates for all maturities given the solved curve.

The underlying assumption is that market quotes represent the \textbf{fair price} of the contracts so they make their NPVs null (the fair price is an estimate of what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for a given asset, assuming both have a reasonable knowledge of the asset's worth).

To illustrate bootstrapping let's consider the following example which can be partially solved analytically: we have some coupon paying bond (coupons of 4\%, 5\%, 6\%, 7\% and 8\% respectively) with maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years, each having a value of \euro{100} and traded at par. To determine the zero-coupon yield curve proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item at the end of the first year the $1^{st}$ bond will pay a coupon of \euro{4} (= \euro{100} * 4\%) plus the principal amount (= \euro{100}) which sums up to \euro{104} while the bond is trading at \euro{100}. Therefore, the implied 1-year spot \emph{fair} rate $S_{1y}$ can be calculated from $\mbox{\euro{100}} = \mbox{\euro{104}} / (1 + S_{1y})$;

\item at the end of second year the sum of the cash flows of the $2^{nd}$ bond can be compared to its trading price to compute the 2-year spot rate $S_{2y}$ from $\mbox{\euro{100}} = \mbox{\euro{5}} / (1 + S_{1y}) + \mbox{\euro{105}} / (1 + S_{2y})^{2}$ where the previously derived value of $S_{1y}$ is used;

\item at the end of third year the sum of the cash flows of the $3^{rd}$ bond can be compared to its trading price to calculate the 3-year spot rate $S_{3y}$ as $\mbox{\euro{100}} = \mbox{\euro{6}} / (1 + S_{1y}) + \mbox{\euro{6}} / (1 + S_{2y})^{2} + \mbox{\euro{106}} / (1 + S_{3y})^{3}$, using $S_{1y}$ and $S_{2y}$ computed before;

\item and so on for the other bonds\ldots
\end{enumerate}

Putting all together we can construct a system of equations (now omitting the currency symbol for simplicity):

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
100 = \cfrac{104}{(1 + S_{1y})} \\
100 = \cfrac{5}{(1 + S_{1y})} + \cfrac{105}{(1 + S_{2y})^{2}} \\
100 = \cfrac{6} {(1 + S_{1y})} + \cfrac{6}{(1 + S_{2y})^{2}} + \cfrac{106} {(1 + S_{3y})^{3}} \\
100 = \cfrac{7} {(1 + S_{1y})} + \cfrac{7} {(1 + S_{2y})^{2}} + \cfrac{7} {(1 + S_{3y})^{3}} + \cfrac{107} {(1 + S_{4y})^{4}} \\
100 = \cfrac{8} {(1 + S_{1y})} + \cfrac{8} {(1 + S_{2y})^{2}}+ \cfrac{8} {(1 + S_{3y})^{3}} + \cfrac{8} {(1 + S_{4y})^{4}} + \cfrac{108} {(1 + S_{5y})^{5}}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:fifth_year_rate}
\end{equation}

This system can be solved quite easily: $S_{1y}$ can be derived from the first equation, $S_{2y}$ from the second, $S_{3y}$ from the third, \ldots So

\begin{equation}
100 = 104 / (1 + S_{1y})\quad\Rightarrow\quad S_{1y} = 104/100 - 1 = 4\%
\end{equation}
Moving to the second equation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& 100 = 5 / (1 + 0.04) + 105 / (1 + S_{2y})^{2}\quad\Rightarrow\quad S_{2y}^2  + 2 S_{2y}  - 0.103030 = 0 \\
& S_{2y} = - 1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 0.103030} = \begin{cases}\text{\sout{-2.05023}} \\ 0.0503\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the first solution has been discarded because negative.

From the third on it is not as simple to solve them analytically since they involve third (or more) order equations. However it is always possible to solve them numerically.
Assume all rates up to the fourth year have been calculated (they are reported in Table~\ref{tab:rates}) and just the last one still needs to be determined.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{years} & \textbf{coupon rate} & \textbf{bond price} & \textbf{spot rate} \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Table reporting maturity, coupon, bond price and implied spot rate for the example outlined in the text.}
\label{tab:rates}
\end{table}

The last column of Table~\ref{tab:rates} provides the terms to fill the zero-coupon yield curve.
To solve the last equation numerically can be chosen one of the many \emph{root finding} algorithms implemented in \texttt{python}. 
In this case \texttt{scipy.optimize.brentq} is used, like the others it finds zeros of a user-defined function within a validity interval.

In Figure~\ref{fig:fifth_year_rate} the last equation of the system in~\ref{eq:fifth_year_rate} is plotted. It already gives an idea of the expected result, indeed the rate value which solves the equation is around 0.08.

\end{codebox}

The very same mechanism can be generalized and extended to other maturities to get a more detailed yield curve. In general terms the previous system becomes

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
f_1(S_1, p_1) = 0 \\
f_2(S_1, S_2, p_2) = 0 \\
f_3(S_1, S_2, S_3, p_3) = 0 \\
f_4(S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, p_4) = 0 \\
\cdots
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $S_i$ are the unknown spot rates and $p_i$ the market quotes of the considered products. The iterative procedure we have applied before exploits the first equation to find $S_1 = f_1^{-1}(p_1)$, the second to find $S_2 = f_2^{-1}(S_1, p_2)$ and so on and so forth. This algorithm relies on the fact that each equation determines exactly one spot rate which is not already determined by the others.

\subsection{Bootstrapping as Minimization Problem}
\label{sec:bootstrap_as_minimization}
The bootstrap algorithm can now be described in general terms as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item define a set of yielding products (e.g. coupon-bearing bonds, swaps);
%\item derive discount factors for the corresponding terms;
\item \emph{bootstrap} the zero-coupon curve, successively calibrating it such that returns the market quotes of these inputs.
\end{enumerate}

Instead of iteratively finding the solution of each equation as before, we could define a vector of spot rates $\mathbf{S} = (S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots)$ seeking for a particular $\mathbf{\hat{S}}$ which solves the following equation:

\begin{equation}
F = f_1^2(\hat{S}_1) + f_2^2(\hat{S}_1, \hat{S}_2) + f_3^2(\hat{S}_1, \hat{S}_2, \hat{S}_3) + f_4^2(\hat{S}_1, \hat{S}_2, \hat{S}_3, \hat{S}_4) + \ldots = 0
\end{equation}

Under this terms the bootstrap method can be considered as a minimization algorithm, indeed we need to find $\mathbf{\hat{S}}$ which \emph{minimize} $F$, and makes it as close as possible to 0.
Notice how each \(f_i\) is squared since we want all of them to be minimized at the same time and not only \(F\) globally (i.e. without the square there may be cancellation effects between the terms of the sum).

\subsection{Minimization Algorithm}\label{minimization-algorithm}

A minimization algorithm follows these steps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  define an \emph{objective function} i.e. the function that has to be minimized to reach our goal;
\item
  set the initial value of the unknown parameters (\(\mathbf{x_0}\)) and their range of variability;
\item
  the algorithm computes the objective function value;
\item
  then it moves the parameter values in such a way to find a smaller
  value of the objective function (e.g. following the derivative direction w.r.t. each parameter); in case constraints are defined, they will be considered when the parameter values are varied;
\item
  the last three steps will be repeated until further variations of the \(\mathbf{x}\) values won't change significantly the objective
  function (i.e. we have found a minimum of the function so the
  minimization process is completed !).
\end{itemize}

Let's see with a couple of example how minimization can be implemented in \texttt{python} using the function \texttt{scipy.optimize.minimize}.

\subsubsection{A Simple Minimization Example}
\label{example}

Find the size of a circular cylindrical can of volume, \(330~\mathrm{cm}^3\), that minimizes the cost of manufacture, see Figure~\ref{fig:cylinder}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{figures/cylinder.png}
\caption{Graphical representation of the \emph{can} minimization example.}
\label{fig:cylinder}
\end{figure}

Clearly to minimize the costs, the company needs to reduce the amount of aluminum used in the production, consequently the can surface, which can be expressed as the sum of the lateral surface plus twice the base surface

\begin{equation*} 
S = 2\pi rh + 2\pi r^2 
\label{eq:can_surface}
\end{equation*}
On the other hand the volume is fixed to 33~cl or 330~\(\mathrm{cm}^3\) and this allows to simplify previous
equation by removing \(h\)

\begin{equation*} 
V = \pi r^2 h = 330\quad\implies h = \cfrac{330}{\pi r^2}
\end{equation*}
Replacing $h$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:can_surface} 

\begin{equation}
S = 2\pi rh + 2\cdot(\pi r^2) = \cfrac{2\cdot 330}{r} + 2\cdot(\pi r^2)
\end{equation}
This is the objective function, and the parameter set (just one parameter in this case) is represented by \(\tt{x[0]}\) which is the can radius in cm. It is convenient to use a \texttt{list} also in this simple case since it can be generalized to more complex problems with larger number of parameters to minimize.

\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}
\noindent
Finally we run the minimization:

\end{codebox}

\begin{curiosity}
So to minimize the cost the company should produce cans with a radius of about 3.745~cm (or about 74~mm diameter). I suspect that Coke or other similar companies have done a similar calculation since the result is surprisingly close to that of real can. 

From \href{	https://www.ball.com/eu/solutions/markets-capabilities/capabilities/beverage-cans/standard-range
}{here} it looks like a real can has a 66.3~mm diameter, a little smaller than our result but it was expected since the base is not flat.    
\end{curiosity}

\subsubsection{Another Example with Constraint}
\label{example-with-constraint}

We are going to fence a rectangular field. If we look at the field
from above the cost of the vertical sides are \$10/m, the cost of the
bottom is \$2/m and the cost of the top side is \$7/m. If we have a \$700 budget determine
the dimensions of the field that will maximize the enclosed area, see Fig.~\ref{fig:field}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/field.png}
\caption{Graphical representation of the \emph{field} minimization example.}
\label{fig:field}
\end{figure}

In this example there are two differences with respect to the previous:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  we want to \emph{maximize} a quantity (not minimize);
\item
  there is a constraint (we have a limited budget).
\end{itemize}

So let's repeat the steps as before. The objective is to maximize the
enclosed area \(A\) and the algorithm can only minimize; nevertheless the objective function can be defined 
to return the quantity \(-A\), so that minimizing its value, the real objective, $A$, is maximized. 
Define length and width of the field respectively as \(\tt{x[0]}\) and \(\tt{x[1]}\) (items of the \texttt{list} \texttt{x}):

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{def} \PY{n+nf}{obj\PYZus{}func}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{:}
    \PY{k}{return} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}}\PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{p}{]}\PY{o}{*}\PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{p}{]}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}
Then we can set the boundaries for length and width, their initial values (1~m each) and the other needed parameters:

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{x0} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{p}{]}
\PY{n}{bounds} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{p}{(}\PY{l+m+mf}{0.01}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+m+mi}{100}\PY{p}{)} \PY{k}{for} \PY{n}{\PYZus{}} \PY{o+ow}{in} \PY{n+nb}{range}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n+nb}{len}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{x0}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{]}
\PY{n}{budget} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{700}
\PY{n}{side\PYZus{}cost} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{10}
\PY{n}{up\PYZus{}cost} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{2}
\PY{n}{down\PYZus{}cost} \PY{o}{=} \PY{l+m+mi}{7}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}

Finally we have to impose the constraint on the budget. This is done by
defining a function that computes the cost of the fence and
compare it to the total budget. 
The constraint is passed to the minimizer with a dictionary (or a list 
of dictionaries if there are more) which has three keys: 
\(\tt{type}\), in this case set to \texttt{'eq'}
(like equality, since we want to spend all of our available money so the
fence has to cost exactly \$700), \texttt{'fun'} which defines the constraint 
function and \texttt{'args'} which is optional and is set to a tuple 
whose items are possible parameters for the constraint function (see Section~\ref{sec:kwargs_args}).

The constraint is then defined as

\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
\mathrm{fence~cost} = l\cdot\mathrm{side\_cost} + l\cdot\mathrm{side\_cost} + w\cdot\mathrm{up\_cost} + w\cdot\mathrm{down\_cost}\\
\mathrm{budget} - \mathrm{fence~cost} = \mathrm{budget} - 2\cdot l\cdot\mathrm{side\_cost} - w\cdot(\mathrm{up\_cost} + \mathrm{down\_cost}) = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{k}{def} \PY{n+nf}{cons}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{budget}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{up\PYZus{}cost}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{down\PYZus{}cost}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{side\PYZus{}cost}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{:}
    \PY{k}{return} \PY{n}{budget} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}} \PY{l+m+mi}{2}\PY{o}{*}\PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{0}\PY{p}{]}\PY{o}{*}\PY{n}{side\PYZus{}cost} \PY{o}{\PYZhy{}} \PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mi}{1}\PY{p}{]}\PY{o}{*}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{up\PYZus{}cost} \PY{o}{+} \PY{n}{down\PYZus{}cost}\PY{p}{)}

\PY{n}{constraints} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{\PYZob{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{type}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{:}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{eq}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{fun}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{:}\PY{n}{cons}\PY{p}{,} 
               \PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{args}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{:}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{budget}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{up\PYZus{}cost}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{down\PYZus{}cost}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{side\PYZus{}cost}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{\PYZcb{}}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}

Now we can call the minimizer.

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{r} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{minimize}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{obj\PYZus{}func}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{x0}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{bounds}\PY{o}{=}\PY{n}{bounds}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{constraints}\PY{o}{=}\PY{n}{constraints}\PY{p}{)}
\PY{n+nb}{print} \PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{r}\PY{p}{)}

    fun: -680.5555555555482
    jac: array([-38.88889313, -17.5       ])
message: 'Optimization terminated successfully'
   nfev: 12
    nit: 4  
   njev: 4
 status: 0
success: True
      x: array([17.49999818, 38.88889293])
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}

So the field will come out 17.5~m long and 38.9~m wide for a total field area of 680.5~$\textrm{m}^2$.

\subsection{Local Minima}
When the objective function has local minima the choice of the initial value of the parameters can be critical. 
Assume we would like to minimize an objective function like 

\[
f(x) = \cfrac{\mathrm{cos}(3\pi x)}{x}
\]
This function is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:local_minima} in the range $[0, 2]$, and clearly it has many minima. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/local_minima.png}
	\caption{Plot of an example function with many local minima. The red points highlights initial value and minimum found in a \emph{bad} minimization, green points for a good minimization.}
	\label{fig:local_minima}
\end{figure}
Let's try to find a minimum and set the initial value to $x=1.1$.
\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{x0} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mf}{1.1}\PY{p}{]}
\PY{n}{bounds} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{p}{(}\PY{l+m+mf}{0.01}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+m+mi}{20}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{]}
		
\PY{n}{r} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{minimize}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{func}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{x0}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{bounds}\PY{o}{=}\PY{n}{bounds}\PY{p}{)}
\PY{n+nb}{print} \PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{r}\PY{p}{)}

     fun: array([-1.00569871])
hess_inv: <1x1 LbfgsInvHessProduct with dtype=float64>
     jac: array([-4.4408921e-07])
 message: b'CONVERGENCE: NORM_OF_PROJECTED_GRADIENT_<=_PGTOL'
    nfev: 16
     nit: 5
  status: 0
 success: True
       x: array([0.98865633])
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}
The minimization worked perfectly and we found $x=0.98865633$ (i.e. the red point in Fig.~\ref{fig:local_minima}) but this is not the absolute minimum we were expecting to find. The problem arise since the algorithm has got stuck in a local minimum without any possibility to jump out from the well.

If we repeat the minimization using as initial value $0.5$ instead
\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{x0} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mf}{0.5}\PY{p}{]}
\PY{n}{bounds} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{p}{(}\PY{l+m+mf}{0.01}\PY{p}{,} \PY{l+m+mi}{20}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{]}
		
\PY{n}{r} \PY{o}{=} \PY{n}{minimize}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{func}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{x0}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{bounds}\PY{o}{=}\PY{n}{bounds}\PY{p}{)}
\PY{n+nb}{print} \PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{r}\PY{p}{)}

     fun: array([-3.17151711])
hess_inv: <1x1 LbfgsInvHessProduct with dtype=float64>
     jac: array([9.76996262e-07])
 message: b'CONVERGENCE: NORM_OF_PROJECTED_GRADIENT_<=_PGTOL'
    nfev: 16
     nit: 5
  status: 0
 success: True
       x: array([0.29691798])
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}
Now clearly the algorithm found the absolute minimum in $x=0.29691798$ (i.e. the green point in Fig.~\ref{fig:local_minima}) because there was no chance to find a local minimum during the iterations.

This is just an example of what could happen when minimizing a function.
When dealing with complicated cases it is possible to make a \emph{scan} of the objective 
function to try to approximately determine where the global minimum is and choose 
suitable initial values of the guess parameters.
However there shouldn't be such an issue in the application of the bootstrap algorithm since the function that is minimized is a sum of squared terms which has no local minimum, just a global minimum (i.e. it is a hyper-parabola).

\subsection{Back to OIS Example}\label{ois-example}
The general idea here is to get the discount curve \(\mathcal{C}\) that prices correctly 
each OIS by minimizing the sum of their NPV squared (our \(f_i\)):

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{min}_{\mathcal{C}} \Big\{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathrm{NPV}(\mathrm{OIS}_i, \mathcal{C})^2\Big\}
\end{equation}

A discount curve is characterized by pillar dates and discount factors. The description of the problem we have given above does not, specifies any constraint on the number of pillar dates of 
the discount curve \(\mathcal{C}\). However, the pillar dates determine the number of unknown variables of the optimization problem. A curve with \(N\) pillar dates has \(N\) discount factors (note that the first discount factor, with value date equal to the today date, is constrained to 1). \textbf{In practice, therefore, it makes sense to choose the pillar dates in such a way that 
	there is exactly the same number of degrees of freedom in the optimization to match data.} 
The natural choice is to choose the pillar dates of the discount curve equal to the set of expiry dates of the swaps.

Once we've fixed \(\mathbf{d}\) to be a vector of pillar dates equal to the expiry dates of the swaps, and we use \(\mathbf{x}\) to represent the vector of discount factors, then the problem becomes:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{min}_{\mathbf{x}} \Big\{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathrm{NPV}(\mathrm{OIS}_i, \mathcal{C}(\mathbf{d}, \mathbf{x}))^2\Big\}
\end{equation}
which is our optimization problem: (\textbf{to find the minimum of the above expression as a function of x}) that can be solved using one of the available numerical optimization routines 
in \texttt{python}.

First the swaps has to be created according to all the available market quotes (also the pillar dates of the unknown discount curve)

Then implement step by step the bootstrapping as described in Section~\ref{sec:bootstrap_as_minimization}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  define the objective function: the sum of the squared NPVs of the OIS

\begin{codebox}

    \PY{k}{return} \PY{n}{sum\PYZus{}sq}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}

\item
  set the initial value of the discount factors (\(x_i^0\)) to 1 with a
  range of variability \([ 0.01, 10]\), today's discount factor is not considered 
  in the list since it is fixed to 1 but is added explicitly in the objective function
  for the calculation of the NPV's (see \texttt{insert} command)

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n}{x0} \PY{o}{=} \PY{p}{[}\PY{l+m+mf}{1.0} \PY{k}{for} \PY{n}{i} \PY{o+ow}{in} \PY{n+nb}{range}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n+nb}{len}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{pillar\PYZus{}dates}\PY{p}{)-1}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{]}

\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}

\item
  finally we can launch the minimizer to find the discount factors
  (\(\mathbf{x}\))

Printing the result gives us the a lot of information about the minimisation just performed, the most useful are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{func}: the value of the objective function at the last iteration;
\item \texttt{message}: the summary message from the algorithm (if it is \texttt{CONVERGENCE} is almost always OK);
\item \texttt{success}: the name is self explanatory;
\item \texttt{x}: the vector of unknown parameters that have been optimised.
\end{itemize}

Another useful check to perform in order to understand if everything went fine, is the comparison of the objective function with the initial guessed parameters and at the end of the minimisation.

\begin{codebox}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PY{n+nb}{print} \PY{p}{(}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{Initial objective function value }\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{objective\PYZus{}function}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{x0}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{)}
\PY{n+nb}{print} \PY{p}{(}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{Final objective function value }\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{objective\PYZus{}function}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{result}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{x}\PY{p}{)}\PY{p}{)}
	
Initial objective function value  26.27213544937082
Final objective function value  5.664309920943246e-11
\end{Verbatim}
\end{codebox}
The objective function at the end of the minimisation is not exactly 0 (and rarely it will be) but its value is small enough for us to be satisfied, the initial value was around $26$ and now it is $10^{-11}$ so 13 orders of magnitude smaller. This means that with the derived discount curve the NPV's of our OIS won't be identically 0 but so small that can be regarded as they would.

It can be very useful to also look at some diagnostic plots to check if the minimization was successful. Figure~\ref{fig:minimization_diagnostic} reports on the left the objective function value as a function of discount factor $(x_0)$; clearly we have found a minimum (the orange point represent $x_0$ value at the end of the minimization). On the right instead, the value of the objective function at each iteration is shown, its value is decreasing dramatically (notice that the $y$ axis is drawn in log scale).

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/obj_func.png}
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/obj_func_iter.png}
	\caption{Diagnostic plots for the minimization algorithm. On the left the objective function value as a function of the discount factor $x_0$, on the right the objective function value as a function of the iteration number (the orange point represent $x_0$ value at the end of the minimization).}

\end{figure}

Finally we can create the discount curve implied by the market quotes of
our swaps (see Fig.~\ref{fig:discount_curve}) and try to compute some implied rates.
