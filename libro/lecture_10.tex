\chapter{Stochastic Process Simulation}

In financial engineering simulation tools have been increasingly gaining 
importance due to both the continuous enhancement of computational efficiency 
and the development of very complex financial, especially derivative
instruments. In this Chapter some practical applications are shown.

\section{Markov Process}

A stochastic or random process can be defined as a collection of 
random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set (usually time), 
meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely 
associated with an element in the set.

A model of the dynamics of asset prices must reflect the random nature
of price movements. Stock prices are usually assumed to follow a 
\emph{Markov process}. Markov processes can be characterized as a
particular type of stochastic processes without any history. Past values
and the way the present has emerged from the past are therefore
irrelevant. 

A particular type of a Markov stochastic
process and presumably the simplest process is the so called \emph{Wiener
process} or elementary Brownian motion, which is characterized by stationary and 
independent increments that are normally distributed based on the size of the increments.
Those increments can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\Delta W = z\sqrt{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
where z is  assumed to be $z ∼ \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and $\mathcal{N}$ represents the standard normal Gaussian. 
The mean of $\Delta W$ is zero and its variance is 
$\Delta t$, which means the standard deviation grows with the square root of time.
It follows that $W(t) ∼ \mathcal{N}(0, t)$. Figure~\ref{fig:wiener_process} shows two examples
of Wiener processes.

\end{figure}

An It$\hat{o}$ process is a stochastic process which satisfy the following stochastic
differential equation (SDE) 
\begin{equation}
dX(t) = \mu(t, X(t)) dt + \sigma(t, X(t)) dW(t)
\end{equation}
notice how we moved to infinitesimal variations in the limit $\Delta t\rightarrow 0$.

In the special case where the \emph{drift} $\mu$ and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ 
deterministic and independent of both the time $t$ and the variable $X$, the process $X(t)$ is called an \emph{arithmetic Brownian motion}. The corresponding SDE is
\begin{equation}
dX(t) = \mu dt + \sigma dW(t)
\end{equation}
thus $X(t) ∼ \mathcal{N}(\mu t, \sigma^2 t)$.

Since an arithmetic Brownian motion can also take
negative values, this type of process is apparently unsuitable for
simulating asset prices. These are rather assumed to follow a \emph{geometric
Brownian motion} (GBM). 

\section{Derivation of log-normal Stochastic Differential Equation}
\label{derivation-of-log-normal-stochastic-differential-equation}

In this Section we will see how to implement the simulation of a stock price 
which deviates from a steady state as a result of random fluctuations given by the trades. 

Considering a stock with a price \(S_t\) and its expected rate of return \(\mu\); the relative change in its price during a period \(dt\) can be decomposed in two parts

\begin{itemize}
	\tightlist
	\item
	a deterministic part: that is the expected return from the stock held
	during the time period \(dt\) and which can be expressed as \(\mu S_tdt\)
	\item
	a stochastic part: which reflects the random changes of the market
	(e.g. as a response to external effects such as unexpected news). A
	reasonable assumption is to take this contribution proportional to the
	stock so \(\sigma S_t dW_t\), where \(dW_t\) is a Wiener process.
\end{itemize}
Putting the two contributions together the resulting SDE is:

\begin{equation}
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
\label{eq:differential}
\end{equation}
or dividing by $S_t$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = d\textrm{log}(S_t) = \mu dt + \sigma dW_t
\end{equation}

The solution of this equation can be derived by applying the
It\(\hat{o}\)'s formula~\cite{bib:ito_lemma}, which states that for any given 
continuous and differentiable function 
\(G(S, t)\) where \(S\) satisfies the following stochastic differential
equation \(dS=a\cdot dt +b\cdot dW_t\) hold

\begin{equation}
dG=\big(a\frac{\partial G}{\partial S} + \frac{\partial G}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}b^2\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial S^2} \big)dt + b \frac{\partial G}{\partial S}dW
\label{eq:itos_lemma}
\end{equation}
which is essentially an extension of the Taylor series expansion for deterministic functions
applicable to stochastic functions.

Now if we set \(G = \textrm{log}(S_t)\) we can compute the derivatives:

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\partial G}{\partial S} = \frac{1}{S_t}\\
\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} = 0\\
\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial S^2} = -\frac{1}{S_t^{2}}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Substituting back into Eq.~\ref{eq:itos_lemma} and taking the values of $a$ and $b$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:differential} we get:

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
d(\textrm{log} S_t) = \big(\mu S_t \cfrac{1}{S_t} + \cfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S_t^2 (-\cfrac{1}{S_t^2})\big)dt + \sigma z\sqrt{dt}\\
d(\textrm{log} S_t) = \textrm{log} (S_t) - \textrm{log} (S_{t-1}) = \textrm{log} \cfrac{S_t}{S_{t-1}} = \big(\mu - \cfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2\big)dt + \sigma z\sqrt{dt}\\
S_t = S_{t-1}e^{\big(\mu - \cfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2\big)dt + \sigma z\sqrt{dt}}
\end{gathered}
\label{eq:gbm_solution}
\end{equation}

As can be seen from the following equation:

\begin{equation}
d(\textrm{log} S_t) = \big(\mu - \cfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2\big)dt + \sigma z\sqrt{dt}
\end{equation}
the change in \(\textrm{log} S_t\) has a constant \emph{drift} with respect to time \(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\) and a constant variance rate \(\sigma^2\)
(remember that \(z\) is a normally distributed random variable
\(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\)). So you have a constant plus a Gaussian
distributed variable, therefore \(\textrm{log} S_t\) at some time \(T\)
is normally distributed with:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{log}S_t - \textrm{log}S_0 \approx\mathcal{N}\big[\big(\mu-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\big)T, \sigma^2 T\big]
\end{equation}

This equation shows that \(\textrm{log}S_t\) is normally distributed,
and \textbf{such a variable whose logarithm is normally distributed is said
to be log-normal}. 

The model we have just developed implies that
the stock price at time T, given today's price, is log-normally
distributed. One of the nicer properties of a log-normal distribution is to be positive defined and that's why log-normality is an important characteristic for stole prices: we need to \emph{ensure} that will never be negative. 

Actually this result was expected, in fact looking at the initial \(dS\) equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:differential}) we had:

\begin{equation}
dS_t = \mu S_tdt + \sigma S_t dW_t
\end{equation}
which shows that the closer \(S_t\) is to 0, the smaller is its variation \(dS\), so it will never go negative.


\section {Simulating Stochastic Differential Equations}
It has been previously shown that we need to simulate SDEs in order to estimate 
quantities of interest if we are unable to compute them analytically. 
This means the simulation is no longer exact, but rather an approximation.

There are several kinds of numerical schemes to solve different SDEs. 
However, we restrict our discussion to the two probably most fundamental methods, 
the Euler scheme and the Milstein scheme. 

As a starting point for both methods, we firstly consider an ordinary SDE of the form
\begin{equation}
dX(t) = \mu(t, X(t))dt + \sigma(t, X(t)) dW (t)
\label{eq:sde}
\end{equation}

Note that both the drift $\mu$ and the diffusion $\sigma$ are functions of the process 
variable $X$ and the time $t$. Suppose that we are interested in simulating values of 
$X(T)$ without knowing its distribution. Possible reasons for this are either 
that Eq.~\ref{eq:sde} is simply not solvable and therefore one is not able to find 
an explicit solution for $X(T)$.

Keep in mind that when we are simulating an SDE, we are actually simulating a 
discretized version of an SDE. Therefore, a general hat notation $\hat{X}$ 
is introduced to indicate that $`\hat{X}$ is a time-discretized approximation of the true value $X$.

\subsection{Euler Scheme}
The Euler scheme is the simplest and probably most common discretization scheme 
available. As already mentioned we generally simulate a discretized process, 
$\{X_b, X_{2b},\ldots, X_{mb}\} = \{X(t_i), X(t_{i+1}),...,X(t_{i+n})\}$, where 
the time steps $\Delta t$ are constant and denoted by $b$. Furthermore, the 
variable $m$ indicates the total number of simulated time steps, while $mb = T$.

Taking these preliminary considerations into account, the Euler scheme is given by
\begin{equation}
X(t_{i+1}) = X(t_i) + \mu(t_i , X(t_i))b + \sigma(t_i , X(t_i))\sqrt{b}Z_{i+1}
\label{eq:euler_scheme}
\end{equation}
where $Z_i$ are independent standard normal random vectors, $Z_i ∼ \mathcal{N}(0,I)$. 
The implementation of this method is straightforward, at least if the drift and the 
diffusion are easy to evaluate.

\subsection{Milstein Scheme}
The accuracy of numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations may 
often be improved by simple Taylor expansions. A very similar strategy also 
applies to SDEs. Yet it is crucial to account for the rules of It$\hat{o}$ calculus 
in order to maintain consistency.

Inspecting the Euler scheme~\ref{eq:euler_scheme} from the perspective of Taylor 
expansions leads to a possible inconsistency: running a Taylor approximation 
expands the drift to the order $O(b)$ but the diffusion term only to $O(\sqrt{b})$. 
This suggests that we focus on the diffusion term in order to advance the Euler 
scheme. And exactly there the Milstein scheme is applied.

The Milstein scheme is defined as an ordinary Euler scheme where the next order 
terms of the It$\hat{o}$-Taylor expansion of Equation~\ref{eq:sde} are additionally 
included. This eventually leads to

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
X(t_{i+1})= X(t_i) &+ \mu(t_i, X(t_i))b+\sigma(t_i,X(t_i))\sqrt{b}Z_{i+1} \\
&+\cfrac{1}{2}\sigma'(t_i ,X(t_i))\sigma (t_i ,X(t_i))b(Z^2_{i+1} −1)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The Milstein approximation thus simply involves the addition of a term to the 
Euler scheme so that both the drift and diffusion terms are expanded to $O(b)$ 
in order to eliminate the inconsistency. The Milstein scheme therefore 
provides a refinement of the Euler scheme based on expanding the 
diffusion term to $O(b)$ rather than just $O(\sqrt{b})$.

However, the question remains whether it is of great difference if 
one applies Euler’s or Milstein’s approximation for a particular 
diffusion equation. In conclusion, the approximations turn out to be very 
close in many simple cases. In more sophisticated models, 
the Milstein scheme appears to be a little better, which may be the additional 
benefit of the increased complexity. Of course, the two approximations do 
not differ at all if the diffusion coefficient $\sigma (t,X(t))$ does not depend on $X(t)$.

\subsection{Simulation of a Stock Price}
Note that the left-hand side of Eq.~\ref{eq:differential} represents the 
proportional change in the asset price in the interval $(t, t + dt)$ and 
additionally shows that $dS/S ∼ \mathcal{N}(\mu dt, \sigma^2 dt)$. 

Equation~\ref{eq:gbm_solution} allows us now to simulate an arbitrary number of possible 
asset price paths by Monte Carlo. Particularly, a random path for an asset 
price can be simulated by sampling repeatedly for $z$ from $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and 
substituting in Eq.~\ref{eq:gbm_solution}.

It is important to note that both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are rates (variation in unit of time) 
that refers to the $\Delta t$ used in the simulation. In other words if $\Delta t = 1\textrm{day}$
then the two parameters should represents the daily variations of the stock price.
Figure~\ref{fig:stock_price_sim} shows possible asset price paths that are assumed to
follow a geometric Brownian motion.

\subsection{Pricing Vanilla European Options by Monte Carlo}
Having generated the sample paths of asset prices under the assumption of a 
certain diffusion process, is quite easy to implement the pricing of
derivative instruments using Monte Carlo. 

A price of derivatives is eventually a function of the underlying 
asset's price and time. Applying It$\hat{o}$'s
lemma, we can calculate the stochastic process followed by a function
whose inputs come from the stochastic process followed by the underlying
itself.

Let us now consider the application of Monte Carlo to a
vanilla European call option. This may seem a little pointless, as there
is the Black-Scholes formula which provides an analytical method that delivers the
true option price much easier. Nevertheless, it builds a good and easy
introduction to identify the exact Monte Carlo procedure. 

The payoff of a call option with strike $K$ and duration $T$ is 

\begin{equation}
(S(T)−K)^+ = \textrm{max}\{0,S(T)−K\}
\end{equation}. 

By multiplying this payoff by a discount factor $e^{−rT}$ we get 
the present value of the payoff. 
The expected present value and thus the call option price $C$ is defined 
by
\begin{equation} 
C = e^{−rT} \mathbb{E}[(S(T) −K)^+ ]
\label{eq:call_payoff}
\end{equation}. 

However, without the knowledge of any distributional
characteristics of the random variable $S(T)$, this expectation is totally
meaningless. It is impossible to price an option without any information
about its distribution of the underlying price or its return. Therefore,
we necessarily need to specify the particular distribution of the final
asset price $S(T)$. 

In the previous Section a model for the dynamics of
stock prices, namely the geometric Brownian motion, was introduced. This
model provides us with the log-normal distribution of $S(T)$, the required
information for a successful option pricing via expected values. Since
we are in a risk-neutral environment, the drift parameter $\mu$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:gbm_solution}
may be replaced by the risk-free rate $r$. Hence it is
straightforward to find the asymptotically correct value for the
European call option by Monte Carlo simulation. 

In a first step, simulate one path for the asset price as it is done 
before and calculate, according to Eq.~\ref{eq:call_payoff}, the corresponding payoff. 
Secondly, repeat this first step numerous times which provides you with several
payoffs. Third and last step, compute the mean payoff and multiply it
with the risk-free discount factor. 

The fact that this Monte Carlo estimate is indeed consistent is illustrated 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:error_BS}. The Figure shows the development of the relative pricing error, 
computed as $(C_n − C)/C$, with a steadily growing sample $n$.
Note that the pricing error is gradually
decreasing and eventually converting to 0 as $n$ goes to infinity. This is
another proof that Monte Carlo provides correct results in the limit.
