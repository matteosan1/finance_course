    "## Description of the classes that we used\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with our code, we imported some fundamental classes from the finmarkets file. We started with the DiscountCurve class. The main attribute of this class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a list pillar dates specifying the value dates of the given discount factors t0,....,tn.\n",
    "* a list of given discount factors D(t0), ..., D(tn).\n",
    "* a pricing date (' observation_date') which corresponds to t0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the discount factor can be expressed as $ D = \\mathrm{exp}( -r ( T-t)) $ , we wrote a function called df for calculating a discount factor at any date, using log-linear interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the formula to calculate the forward rates can be found exploiting the no arbitrage condition $ (1 + r1T1) (1 + r1,2 (T2 - T1)) = 1 + r2T2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important class used is the OvernightIndexSwap. OIS are products which pay a floating coupon, determined by overnight rate fixings over the reference periods, against a fixed coupon. By definition an OIS is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a notional amount N\n",
    "* a start date d0\n",
    "* a sequence of payment dates d1, ..., dn\n",
    "* a fixed rate K\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to take a series of OIS quotations ('ois_data.quotes'), and determine the OIS's NPV given a certain discount curve. However, using the Bootstrapping technique we are going to somehow reverse this procedure. Therefore, the final aim will be to get the discount curve such that it prices correctly each OIS ( by minimizing the sum of the square NPVs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we imported generateswap dates, a function which given a start date and the number of months, returns a list of dates of annual frequency starting from the start date and ending after the specified number of months."
