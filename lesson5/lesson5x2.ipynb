    "\n",
    "Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) are products which pay a floating coupon, determined by overnight rate fixings over the reference periods, against a fixed coupon. Interest rate swaps are usually used to mitigate the risks of fluctuations of varying interest rates, or to benefit from lower interest rates. We will always look at these products from the point of view of the **receiver of the floating leg**.\n",
    "By definition an OIS is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a notional amount $N$\n",
    "* a start date $d_0$\n",
    "* a sequence of payment dates $d_1,...,d_n$\n",
    "* a fixed rate $K$\n",

    "(n.b. for simplicity we're assuming that the fixed and floating legs have the same notional and payment dates, although this is not necessarily always the case in practice).\n",

    "At each payment date, the floating leg pays a cash flow determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{\\mathrm{float},~i} = N \\Bigg\\{\\prod_{d=d_{i-1}}^{d=d_i-1}\\Big(1+r_{o/n}(d)\\cdot\\frac{1}{360}\\Big) -1 \\Bigg\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(This formula is valid for an EONIA swap, i.e. for OIS swaps in EUR, other currencies might have different conventions. The $\\frac{1}{360}$ fraction appears because EONIA rates are quoted using the ACT/360 daycount convention and here we're making the simplifying assumption of ignoring weekends and holidays, so we assume that each overnight rate is valid for only one day.)\n",

    "The sum of the discounted expected values of these cash flows is\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next we are going to somehow reverse what we have previously done (i.e. we determined the OIS's NPV given a certain discount curve). \n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea here is to get the discount curve such that it prices correctly each OIS, or at least as well as possible, by minimizing the sum of the square NPVs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{min}_{curve} \\Big\\{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{NPV}(\\mathrm{ois}_i, \\mathrm{curve})^2\\Big\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A discount curve is characterized by pillar dates and the corresponding discount factors. The description of the problem we have given above does not, in theory, specifies any constraint on the pillar dates of the discount curve. However, the pillar dates determine the number of unknown variables (i.e. the dimensionality $n$ of the optimization problem). A curve with $n$ pillar dates has $n$ discount factors (note that the first discount factor with value date equal to the today date, is constrained to 1).\n",
    "**In practice, therefore, it makes sense to choose the pillar dates in such a way that there are exactly the right number of degrees of freedom in the optimization to match data.** So the natural choice is to choose the pillar dates of the discount curve equal to the set of expiry dates of the swaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is that each market quote will determine exactly one *free* discount factor which is not already determined by the other market quotes - this can be seen by considering the mathematical expression for calculating the fixed leg of the OIS swaps ($f_{\\mathrm{fix},~i}=N\\cdot K\\cdot D(d_i)\\cdot\\frac{d_i - d_{i-1}}{360}$), and the way that the payment date schedules are constructed.\n",
    "Therefore, once we've fixed $\\vec{d}$ to be a vector of pillar dates equal to the expiry dates of the OIS swaps, and we use the notation $\\vec{x}$ to represent the vector of pillar discount factors, then the problem becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{min}_{\\vec{x}} \\Big\\{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{NPV}(\\mathrm{ois}_i, \\mathrm{curve(\\vec{d}, \\vec{x})})^2\\Big\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this is an optmization problem (**to find the minimum of the above expression as a function of $\\vec{x}$**) so we can just use one of the available numerical optimization routines.\n",
