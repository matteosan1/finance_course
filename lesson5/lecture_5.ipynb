    "# Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive session (e.g notebook or interactive shell) is great for quick testing and exploratory use, but once you have some code (i.e. functions or classes) which you'd like to reuse often, rather than copy/pasting it every time you need it, you can save it in a .py file and use it from your session (aka you can create your own library).\n",
    "\n",
    "These work just like the modules we have been importing up to now, except they're written by us...\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start writing a module called **finmarkets**, and over the course of the remaining lessons we'll add functionality related to the theory lessons (you will be asked\n",
    "to use this module for your final project !).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqCl65wxikw) for an example of how using your own module is done for *Jupyter notebook*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead if you prefer to work with *repl.it* please look at a this (https://repl.it/@MatteoSani/finmarkets) skeleton of project which has already a finmarkets module example. \n",
    "\n",
    "So first of all let's create a new file called finmarkets.py and copy into it the ```DiscountCurve``` class you have written last time. As for any other module we can import it and use its classes and functions."

    "# Overnight Index Swap\n",
    "\n",
    "Overnight Index Swaps (OIS) are products which pay a floating coupon, determined by overnight rate fixings over the reference periods, against a fixed coupon. We will always look at these products from the point of view of the **receiver of the floating leg**.\n",
    "By definition an OIS is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a notional amount $N$\n",
    "* a start date $d_0$\n",
    "* a sequence of payment dates $d_1,...,d_n$\n",
    "* a fixed rate $K$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we're assuming that the fixed and floating legs have the same notional and payment dates, although this is not necessarily always the case in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each payment date, the floating leg pays a cash flow determined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{\\mathrm{float},~i} = N \\Bigg\\{\\prod_{d=d_{i-1}}^{d=d_i-1}\\Big(1+r_{o/n}(d)\\cdot\\frac{1}{360}\\Big) -1 \\Bigg\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(This formula is valid for an EONIA swap, i.e. for OIS swaps in EUR, other currencies might have different conventions. The $\\frac{1}{360}$ fraction appears because EONIA rates are quoted using the ACT/360 daycount convention and here we're making a simplifying assumption of ignoring weekends and holidays, so we assume that each overnight rate is valid for only one day.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the discounted expected values of these cashflows is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{NPV}_{\\mathrm{float}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_i)\\mathbb{E}[f_{\\mathrm{float},~i}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D(d)$ is the discount factor with expiry $d$. On the other hand, by definition (remember practical lesson 4 with forward rates), we also have the following relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[f_{\\mathrm{float},~i}] = N\\cdot\\Big(\\frac{D_{ois}(d_{i-1})}{D_{ois}(d_{i})} - 1\\Big) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "hence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{NPV}_{\\mathrm{float}} = N\\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_i) \\Big(\\frac{D_{ois}(d_{i-1})}{D_{ois}(d_{i})} - 1\\Big) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_{ois}(d)$ is the discount factor implied by OIS prices (we will see it better in the next lesson, for the moment remember what we said last time about EONIA index).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous theory lesson we mentioned that the correct curve to use for discounting the flows of a collateralized contract is the one associated with the collateral. Since OIS contracts are collateralized with cash, and cash accrues daily interes at the overnight rate, the OIS curve is itself the correct curve with which to discount the flows of an OIS contract !\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, $D = D_{ois}$ so the NPV simplifies to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{NPV}_{\\mathrm{float}} = N\\cdot\\sum_{i=1}^{n}[D(d_{i-1}) - D(d_i)] =  \\\\\n",
    " = N\\cdot[(D(d_{0}) - D(d_{1})) + (D(d_{1}) - D(d_{2})) + ... + (D(d_{n-1}) - D(d_{n}))]\\\\\n",
    " = N \\cdot [D(d_0) - D(d_n)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cash flow of the fixed leg is equal to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{\\mathrm{fix},~i}=N\\cdot K\\cdot \\frac{d_i - d_{i-1}}{360}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so the NPV of the fixed leg is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{NPV}_{\\mathrm{fix}} = N\\cdot K\\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n}D(d_{i})\\frac{d_i - d_{i-1}}{360}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately the aim will be to take a series of OIS quotations, and determine the discount factors implied by their prices. To do this we'll build a pricing `class`, which takes discount curve as the input and produces the net present value (NPV) of the OIS as the output. Next lesson we'll put this function inside a numerical optimizer to invert the process to determine the implied discount factors from the prices."
