    "### Linear interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "It may happen to have few data points, obtained by sampling or experimenting, which represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of an independent variable (e.g. in recording a trip: distances at certain times). It is often required to interpolate, i.e. estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable (e.g. in our previous example what is the distance at new times ?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's exercise on linear interpolation (and extrapolation because yes in same cases you can also get new points outside the measured range) with a couple of examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "Assume you are going on holidays by car and that luckily there isn't much traffic so that you can drive at constant speed (which gives a linear relation between travelled space and time i.e. $s = v \\cdot t$, which means that if you'd plot the distances $s$ as a function of the time $t$ you get a line with slope $v$).\n",
    "Given two samples of the car travelled distance $s_1$ and $s_2$ taken at two different times $t_1$ and $t_2$ you can linearly interpolate to find your position at different times using the following relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w = \\frac{t - t_1}{t_2 - t_1}$$ \n",
    "($t$ generic time at which we want to know the distance $s$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = (1 - w)\\cdot s_1 + w \\cdot s_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***Derivation***\n",
    "The equation of a line for two points $(t_1, s_1)$ and $(t_2, s_2)$ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{t - t_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \\frac{s - s_1}{s_2 - s_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting $w = \\frac{t - t_1}{t_2 - t_1}$ and solving for $s$ we find the desired solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w = \\frac{s - s_1}{s_2 - s_1} \\Rightarrow (s_2 - s_1)\\cdot w = s - s_1 \\Rightarrow ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our example, if $s_1 = 25.75~\\mathrm{km}\\;(@t_1 = 15~\\mathrm{min})$ and $s_2 = 171.7~\\mathrm{km}\\;(@t_2 = 100~\\mathrm{min})$ let's compute:"
