You are asked to:\n","* Train a neural network to determine implied volatilities from a set of call and put options.\n","* Plot the \"volatility smile\" (volatility vs option strike).\n","\n","The input parameters are:\n","* market quotes of a set of puts and calls;\n","* USD Libor rate;\n","* historical series and current price of the underlying asset.\n","\n","In the training process try to optimize the network architecture by both checking configurations with 1,2 and 3 hidden layers and different number of epochs (avoiding overfitting) with the goal of reaching an accuracy (MSE) of about 1e-4. Assume also the following ranged for strike and sigma in creating the training sample:\n","* K = [105, 190]\n","* sigma = [0.2, 0.4]\n","\n","### Notes and Hints\n","\n","Numerical results must be presented to the examining committee during a presentation in which the candidates will also explain the theoretical framework of the neural networks. The code should be well explained and should use as much as possible the modules developed during the course."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-iKDkUgasLmy"},"source":["## Inputs\n","\n","[call and put definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteosan1/finance_course/develop/Projects/call_put.csv)\n","\n","[historical series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteosan1/finance_course/develop/Projects/proj_9.csv)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tbHiKSgtLZS1"},"source":["strike_range = [105, 190]\n","sigma_range = [0.2, 0.4]\n","r = 0.0004\n","S0 = 149.5\n","ttm = 0.5"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
