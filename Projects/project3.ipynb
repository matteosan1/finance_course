The fixed rate of the swap is such that if there was no counterparty risk, the product would be traded at par. You are requested to compute it;\n","* a set of survival probabilities for the risky counterparty;\n","* the recovery rate for this swap (i.e. the fraction of the market value that it is expected to recover in case of default);\n","* the volatility of the swap rate, which is assumed to be constant through time (the swap rate is lognormal with fixed volatility).\n","\n","The swap starts today and the horizon for the VAR calculation is before any future payments. \n","\n","## Notes and Hints\n","\n","Numerical results must be presented to the examining committee during a presentation in which the candidates will also explain the theoretical framework for credit risk evaluation.\n","\n","Please try to reuse as much as possible the code in $\\texttt{finmarkets.py}$, and only when it is not viable write your own classes.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fwJbe7XDSNFG"},"source":["## Inputs\n","\n","[Overnight swap quotes](https://github.com/matteosan1/finance_course/raw/develop/Projects/ois_quotes.xlsx)\n","\n","[Counterparty survival probabilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteosan1/finance_course/develop/Projects/survival_probabilities_proj3.csv)\n","\n","[Euribor 6M rates (choose right sheet)](https://github.com/matteosan1/finance_course/raw/develop/Projects/euribor_curve.xlsx)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OmwtSOHju6FO"},"source":["from datetime import date\n","from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n","\n","irs_to_price = {\n","    'nominal': 100e6, \n","    'libor_tenor_months': 6,\n","    'fixed_leg_frequency': 6,\n","    'maturity_months': 72\n","}\n","\n","pricing_date = date.today()\n","credit_var_date = pricing_date + relativedelta(years=2)\n","recovery = 0.4\n","volatility = 0.4\n","mc_runs = 100000\n","percentile = 0.999"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
