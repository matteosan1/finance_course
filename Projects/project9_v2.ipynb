Then you have to plot the \"volatility smile\" (volatility vs option strike) for each. For comparison, with the given market quotes, compute the call and put prices using BS formula using the underlying historical volatility. \n","\n","The input parameters are:\n","\n","* market quotes of a set of puts and calls;\n","* USD Libor rate;\n","* historical series of the underlying.\n","\n","In the training process try to optimize the network checking configurations with 1,2 and 3 hidden layers and in terms of number of epochs (avoiding overfitting) with the goal of reaching an accuracy (MSE) of at least 1e-4. \n","Assume also the following ranged for strike and sigma in creating the training sample:\n","\n","* $K$ = [7.5, 30]\n","* $\\sigma$ = [0.4, 0.8]\n","\n","### Notes and hints\n","\n","Numerical results must be presented to the examining committee during a presentation in which the candidates will also explain the theoretical framework of the neural networks. The code should be well explained and should use as much as possible the modules developed during the course."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["[call/put definitions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteosan1/finance_course/develop/Projects/call_put_v2.csv)\n","\n","[historical series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteosan1/finance_course/develop/Projects/proj9_v2.csv)"],"metadata":{"id":"zPMC4Ms1Yu_a"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Pd_yMjlvX68n"},"outputs":[],"source":["strike_range = [7.5, 30] # strike range for training sample\n","sigma_range = [0.4, 0.8] # sigma range for training sample\n","S0 = 17.00 # today underlying price\n","r = 0.00034 # USD Libor fixing\n","ttm = 0.5"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
